Please help us complete it. This case is also ongoing, so details are subject to change. </em></p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>In 2015 the South Australian government established a Royal Commission to investigate the implications for the state's involvement in the four stages of the nuclear fuel cycle (mining, enrichment, energy and storage). The final report was presented to the government in May 2016 and forms the starting point for this state-wide engagement process. <a href=\"http://nuclearrc.sa.gov.au/app/uploads/2016/02/NFCRC-Tentative-Findings.pdf\">The report </a>concludes that is safe for South Australia to participate in these activities and makes some recommendations on costs and revenue. </p><p>The Royal Commission's findings provide a solid evidence base on which South Australians can evaluate their positions on the state's future role in nuclear fuel. The aims of the engagement process are two-fold: to inform the community of the findings and understand the evidence, as well as considering the options available. The Royal Commission is independent from state government. </p><h3>History</h3><p>The South Australian government has a strong record for implementing deliberative democratic processes and seeking community engagement in politics. This initiative is part of the SA government's <a href=\"http://yoursay.sa.gov.au/reforming-democracy\">Reforming Democracy </a>agenda, which aims to deliver 'four deliberative democracy projects' as well as a range of other engagement processes which \"include a focus on the use of digital technologies and explore the application of crowd sourcing, collaborative working and resource sharing, and design thinking approaches to areas of government activity\" (YourSAy 2016). </p><p>The impetus behind the Nuclear engagement was that \"there is a tradeoff worth exploring\" (newDemocracy Foundation 2016). The Royal Commission Report concluded that nuclear fuel storage could add significantly to the SA economy. However, this is a controversial issue with strong feelings on either side. The engagement strategy for the initiative was prepared by newDemocracy and outlined two key problems that the process aims top counter: firstly, that no one really reads Royal Commission reports and secondly that most people assume that despite engaging with the community, government decision-makers have usually already made a decision either way. The process was designed with these two challenges in mind. </p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>This process was instigated and funded by the government of South Australia. newDemocracy Foundation, an independent nonprofit organisation, designed an engagement strategy for the nuclear issue and designed the engagement process for the two citizens' juries. DemocracyCo facilitated the first jury in July 2016. </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The recruitment of participants for Citizens' Jury 1 was carried out by newDemocracy, independently from government. Invitations were sent out to a random sample of 25,000 households generated by software. Addresses were provided by Australia Post's database and invitations were sent by post. 1,121 people then registered their interest in taking part, and a random stratified sample was taken from this group to ensure that the final jury reflected the demographics of the South Australian population. The final jurors selected numbered 54 - with 4 of those as reserves in case of emergency (YourSAy 2016a).</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>This engagement program is ongoing, with the first stage ending in November 2016. Below are the details of the process so far (August 2016). <a href=\"http://nuclear.yoursay.sa.gov.au/citizens-juries/citizens-jury-one\">The YourSAy website has a number of videos and documents about the first Citizens' Jury. </a></p><p><em>Citizens' Jury 1</em></p><p>The first stage in the nuclear engagement was a citizens' jury of 50 South Australians that took place over four days (two weekends) in June - July 2016. The purpose of this jury was to examine the Royal Commission's report and produce some key issues that should be discussed during the state-wide consultation. The jury's task was essentially to set the agenda for wider community consultation: identifying key issues from the report that the whole community needs to consider. This involves balancing and processing a large amount of complex information, but also having to write a report in accessible terms for the whole community who have not participated in the jury. The SA Premier Jay Weatherill emphasised that the aim of Jury 1 was not to say yes or no to nuclear fuel storage, but to \"assist us [the govt] to make the best possible decision\" (Weatherill 2016). </p><p>Day 1 of Jury 1 focussed on explaining the jury process and welcomes and introductions. Welcomes were given by the Premier and a representative of the Kaurna people whose country it is.The key objective for the day was to explain the Royal Commission in terms of its process and outcome. In particular, there was a panel discussion with members of the Royal Commission and scrutiny over its independence from government. The jury also worked towards identifying which experts they were like to hear from, and the parts of the Royal Commission report that they wanted to explore in more depth. Jurors worked together in small groups and in plenary to do this. This work also involved preparing for Day 2, where jurors would hear from expert witnesses. </p><p>Day 2 of Jury 1 was dedicated to expert witness presentations. There were 8 presentations in total, given in two panels of four, with Q&As. The jury heard from a variety of perspectives including aboriginal views, scientist, business, tourism and agriculture. Videos of the jury reflected positively on the day, with jurors commenting that their views were being challenged, and they enjoyed hearing a range of perspectives (YourSAy 2016b).</p><p>The Day 3, Jury 1 program focussed deliberation on four key areas: consent, safety, trust and economics. These were areas that the jury had selected in previous deliberations as areas of importance. Jurors could join what group they were particularly interested in. Group deliberations on the four areas took place in three rounds of discussion. In the first two rounds that took place in the morning session, expert witnesses were available for the jury to provide extra infromation and answer questions in the form of panels on each topic. After lunch for the third round, the jury could deliberate by themselves on the topic. Facilitators split the room into four with tape on the floor to indicate the different groups. Day 3 paved the way for the jury to begin planning the report they would need to write and present to the Premier on Day 4. The final part of Day 3 enabled nominated jurors from each group to feed back to the whole group on their deliberations from the four areas. Central to this exercise was the jury working towards consensus - not on the question of fuel storage itself but on what should go in their report. </p><p>Jurors commented that they felt everybody had the opportunity to participate in some way in the jury. They felt that they were making progress, but some felt that they still needed additional information, or were grappling with the complexity of the issue. Some people felt that they were still at the beginning of the process - which is true given that Jury 1 is the first stage in a state-wide engagement (YourSAy 2016c).</p><p>The final day of Jury 1 was dedicated to the jury writing the report for the Premier which would identify the agenda for wider community consultation. Jurors worked in small groups on the different sections of the report, then came together to finalise the overall report. Towards the end of the day the jury presented their report in person to the Premier. Several jurors were nominated/volunteered to give informal presentations and summaries of the report, including outlining the jury process itself. The jury also came up with some principles for decision-making to encourage people to think about the issue in a thoughtful way. These principles included transparency, inclusivity, accountability and ongoing consultation. </p><p><a href=\"http://assets.yoursay.sa.gov.au/production/2016/07/12/10/28/13/df622a91-cdbb-486d-bbed-20796a4109d5/Nuclear%20Citizens'%20Jury%20FINAL%20Book.pdf\">The jury's final report</a> aims to answer the question \"What are the parts of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission'’s Report that everyone needs to discuss?\" It focuses on the four key areas mentioned above. The document is intended to set the agenda and kick-start discussions on nuclear fuel storage in the state-wide engagement that followed Jury 1. </p><p><em>State-wide engagement</em></p><p>Between August and October 2016, around 100 events will take place across South Australia. These are informal, drop-in sessions in various locations, where people are encouraged to come in and talk about the issue. There is not much information available on the format or content of these sessions. Venues range from local shopping centres to aboriginal communities and town halls and sessions are generally open from 11am - 7pm. </p><p>Alongside the face-to-face meetings around the state, online forums on each of the four areas are open for discussion through <a href=\"http://nuclear.yoursay.sa.gov.au/get-involved/YourSay-discussion\">YourSAy</a>. There are a fairly high number of comments on each thread, but they are made by a smaller group of commenters. The same individuals also comment on multiple threads. Notably, the tone of the online discussions is predominantly anti-nuclear, with a few dissenting. Whilst the discussions do delve into some of the more complex technical issues, the comments are at times vitriolic. Several posts are re-posted in different threads, somewhat blurring the four key areas as outlined by the original jury. There is also a feedback survey to comment on the Royal Commission and social media pages; the majority of the comments there are also predominantly anti-nuclear as well as anti-government and in some cases, anti-citizens' jury. </p><p><em>Citizens' Jury 2</em></p><p>The second citizens' jury will bring together the original 50 jurors from the first jury, along with an additional 300 South Australians.</p><p><em>\"This jury is to review all the community feedback from the state-wide consultation program, in addition to finalising their own perspectives from examining the Royal Commission’s Report. The Jury will capture their deliberations in a report that will be provided to the Premier, Jay Weatherill, as a key input to the Government’s decision-making process\" </em>(YourSAy 2016d)</p><p>Following this jury, the final decision will be with the state government in November 2016.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The beginning of the Citizens' Jury process received a good deal of <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/ndf-work/316-sa-cj-nuclear-fuel-cycle\">media and public attention.</a> Anti-nuclear protesters gathered outside the jury venue and \"mobbed\" the Premier as he arrived on the first day. The first jury took place two days after the UK voted to leave the EU, and this was also discussed in the news in relation to the media. Advocates of deliberative approaches pointed to Brexit as an example of what happens when meaningful political engagement is not possible or facilitated by government. This purportedly leaves concerned citizens with only more radical means of getting their voices heard such as protest. </p><p>As this case is ongoing, it is too premature to speculate on the influence or outcomes of the process. </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p><em>The analysis below is the view of the writer. This case is ongoing and any analysis is preliminary and tentative. </em></p><p>It is too early to draw any solid conclusions from this case given it is still ongoing. However, there are a few points worth noting at this stage. Perhaps the most significant from a deliberative perspective is the marked difference between the tone of the online discussion forums and the citizens' jury. There is a large repository of videos of the first jury so it is possible to infer something about the atmosphere and the way deliberations were conducted. Feedback from jurors on these videos seem to show satisfaction with the process, enthusiasm to learn about the issue from all perspectives, and commitment in taking part. On the other hand, online discussions appear to show mistrust of the government in its agenda and in the engagement process itself. Some commentators are suspicious of the citizens' jury process itself.</p><p>There are two related issues that can be discerned from this distance. Firstly, the citizens' jury process aims to include the voices of everyday citizens. The aim of sampling, ideally, in a citizens' jury is based on the representative logic of a mini-public - creating a microcosm of the public. In doing this, the sample is more likely to comprise of a mix of viewpoints on the issue. By contrast, self-selecting processes may attract the most passionate voices to participate in discussion. Whilst it is obviously important for passionate advocates to express their views, typically these loud voices will dominate a debate.</p><p>Concomitantly, the online discussions on nuclear in SA seem to (so far) be dominated by anti-nuclear activists. There are to be sure, some pro-nuclear commentors. There is far less indication of those people may be undecided or not have a strong view. This binary can lead to divisive commentary. Nuclear fuel storage is clear a controversial issue, with strong views on either side; any debate is likely to spark high emotions. </p><p>From a deliberative democracy perspective, the more concerning point is the mistrust in the process itself, regardless of the issue. This could indicate the need - more generally - to better explain the process of citizens' juries including the selection process and information provision to wider publics. </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>newDemocracy Foundation (2016) Nuclear fuel cycle engagement - South Australia's department of premier and cabinet, available at: <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/ndf-work/316-sa-cj-nuclear-fuel-cycle \">http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/ndf-work/316-sa-cj-nuclear-fuel-cycle </a></p><p>Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission (2016) Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission - tentative findings [pdf], available at: <a href=\"http://nuclearrc.sa.gov.au/app/uploads/2016/02/NFCRC-Tentative-Findings.pdf\">http://nuclearrc.sa.gov.au/app/uploads/2016/02/NFCRC-Tentative-Findings.pdf</a></p><p>Weatherill, J (2016) Interview with Channel 9 News [YouTube], 25 June, available at: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BhAIO5tQmE&feature=youtu.be \">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BhAIO5tQmE&feature=youtu.be </a></p><p>YourSAy (2016) Reforming Democracy: Deciding, Designing and Delivering Together, Government of South Australia, available at: <a href=\"http://yoursay.sa.gov.au/reforming-democracy\">http://yoursay.sa.gov.au/reforming-democracy</a></p><p>YourSAy (2016a) Background of the jury, Government of South Australia, available at: <a href=\"http://nuclear.yoursay.sa.gov.au/background-of-the-jury\">http://nuclear.yoursay.sa.gov.au/background-of-the-jury</a></p><p>YourSAy (2016b) Citizens' Jury Day 2: thoughts from the jury [YouTube] available at: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9RA-4VKFcf0\">https://youtu.be/9RA-4VKFcf0</a></p><p>YourSAy (2016c) Day 3 update: thoughts from the jurors [YouTube], available at: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jCZQflKgBf0\">https://youtu.be/jCZQflKgBf0</a></p><p>YourSAy (2016d) The Engagement Process, Government of South Australia, available at: <a href=\"http://nuclear.yoursay.sa.gov.au/know-nuclear/engagement-process\">http://nuclear.yoursay.sa.gov.au/know-nuclear/engagement-process</a></p><p> </p><br /><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>   <p> </p>","title":"Get to know Nuclear: Nuclear Fuel Cycle engagement in South Australia","language":"en","case_id":4558,"authors":[{"user_id":134860,"timestamp":"2016-08-29T05:04:56-07:00","name":"Ryan Côté"}]},{"id":4556,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)","communication_mode":"or Deliberation","communication_with_audience":null,"content_country":null,"decision_method":null,"end_date":"2017-03-30T13:00:00.000Z","facetoface_online_or_both":"facetoface","facilitated":"Yes","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":6,"ongoing":true,"post_date":"2016-08-26T09:06:19.000Z","published":true,"start_date":"2016-05-31T14:00:00.000Z","total_number_of_participants":24,"updated_date":"2016-08-26T09:50:11.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"General Public","kind_of_influence":null,"targeted_participants_public_role":"Lay Public","targeted_audience":null,"participant_selection":"Random Selection","specific_topic":"Public Services and Facilities","staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)","typical_implementing_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_sponsoring_entity":null,"who_else_supported_the_initiative":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":216,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":"Eurobodalla","province":"New South Wales","country":"Australia","postal_code":null,"latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E"},"lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["infrastructure"],"body":"<p><em>This case is ongoing - if you know something about it, let us know!

If you know something about this case, please help us complete it.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Glenunga is a suburb in the South Australian city of Adelaide. It is in the local government area (local council) of Burnside. In October 2008 Burnside council dicussed the possibility of developing a new community hub in the area. The impetus for this was the underuse or poor state of other local parks and facilities. However, it was decided that before proceeding, a feasibility study ought to be undertaken to determine the need for a community and sports hub, and assess the community's needs and views. </p><p>The purpose of the 'needs analysis and feasibility study' was ultimately to do just that - assess the needs of the community regarding the hub, and determine how feasible the project was. The aim was not to engage with the actual planning process, which was dependent on exogenous factors like funding (City of Burnside 2009, p5).</p><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>The engagement process was instigated by the City of Burnside council and funded by them. $50,000 (AUD) was set aside to develop the proposal for the community hub, although it's not clear how much of this went towards the community consultation stage of the proposal. The community engagement process was organised by Simply Speaking Seanachai, and the feasibility study report prepared by Hames Sharley, an architects firm.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Five focus groups were held with two for local sports and social clubs, and three for the local community. It is not clear how participants were recruited to take part. 15 people attended the former and 24 the latter.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Two sets of focus groups were held, with stakeholders (sports and social clubs) and the local community. The content for each varied slightly, with the sports and social club groups focussing on specific issues such as the membership numbers and whether there had been a growth or slump in the numbers of people using the club or sports facilities. Participants also discussed what they did <em>not </em>want to see happen in terms of a future community hub.</p><p>The community focus groups were held over two mornings and one evening. During these sessions, a technique called<a href=\"http://flash.lakeheadu.ca/~kbrown/F2250%20Webpages/focused_conversation.html\"> 'focussed conversations' </a>was used to help guide discussion. This method divides the conversation up into manageable, natural ways of discussing a topic. Overall there was general support for the development of a multi-purpose community hub that could be used by different sports clubs and with other facilities.</p><p>In addition to the focus groups, members of the community also made written submissions; these comments reflected the feelings expressed in the community focus groups.</p><p>Participants were asked to evaluate the focus group sessions to contribute to an ongoing effort to improve community engagement, but only a small number of evaluation forms were turned in. Out of the smaller pool of evaluation data, feedback was positive with people feeling that they had gained something from the experience of participating (Hames Sharley 2009, p29).</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Following the feasibility study, Burnside council decided to pursue the community hub project, since the consultation \"identified that there was both an opportunity for improvement and general interest within the community for the development of a hub that is available for the whole community\" (City of Burnside 2012). Following this, a further community consultation was undertaken to inform the development of the community hub and in 2012 the council approved the Master Plan for the Glenunga community hub (City of Burnside 2012). </p><p>The new <a href=\"http://www.greenwayarchitects.com.au/glenunga-hub/\">Glenunga Community Hub</a> was opened in February 2016.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>City of Burnside Council (2012)<em> Complete background to the Glenunga community hub project </em>[pdf - attached below]</p><p>Hames Sharley (2009) <em>Glenunga Community Hub Feasibility Study: needs analysis report</em> [pdf], available at: <a href=\"http://www.simplyspeaking.net.au/uploads/6/2/4/4/6244578/glenunga_community_hub_needs_analysis_report_revision_1.pdf\">http://www.simplyspeaking.net.au/uploads/6/2/4/4/6244578/glenunga_commun...</a></p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>","title":"Glenunga Community Hub ","language":"en","case_id":4554,"authors":[{"user_id":134860,"timestamp":"2016-08-24T05:10:53-07:00","name":"Ryan Côté"}]},{"id":4490,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)","communication_mode":"Express opinions/preferences only","communication_with_audience":"Public Report","content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":"Not Applicable","end_date":null,"facetoface_online_or_both":"facetoface","facilitated":"Yes","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":null,"post_date":"2016-07-19T08:05:15.000Z","published":true,"start_date":null,"total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T01:51:53.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"General Public","kind_of_influence":"Consultation (i.e. to advise decision makers)","targeted_participants_public_role":"Elected Public Official","targeted_audience":"Organized Groups (e.g. NGOs, Business Associations)","participant_selection":"Appointment","specific_topic":"undefined","staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_implementing_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_sponsoring_entity":"International Organization","who_else_supported_the_initiative":"InterParliamentary Union","who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":4487,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"33° 43' 45.7968\" N","longitude":"73° 5' 35.3256\" E"},"lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["performance monitoring","democratic accountability","citizen panel"],"body":"<h3>Problem/Purpose</h3><p>In Pakistan, beyond the electoral moment, there are very few non-partisan avenues for evaluating parliamentary performance. The Pakistani Parliament, with a unique history of military intervention, corruption and lack of accountability and transprency, currently faces a serious crisis of legitimacy. The project was initated to bridge the gap between democracy, in theory, and democracy in practice, by studying the downfalls and strenghts of a central instittion, the parliament. According the Inter-Parliamentary Union's  \"A Guide to Good Practice\" on democracy in the 21st century, the strong parliametary functions is the key to healthy democracy as the institution embodies the will of the people as well as their expectations for responsiveness to their needs as a representative and legislative organ. PILDAT's reports focus on monitoring parliamentary performance in different ways, through the perspective of civil society, international standards and citizens. The aim of this project is to evaluate the performance of Pakistani parliament through an international critiria to identify priorities and strenghts. IPU also provides a comprehensive record of Pakistan's parliamentary structure, mandate and logistics in its archives to help many think tanks perform evaluations in its PARLINE database. PILDAT's annual report for the 13th National Assembly's performance revealed a decrease in almost every sector of legislative activity (attenance, questions asked, notices received etc.), failures in reforming the parliamentary budget process, failure to replace the dissolution of the National Accountability Bureau with an independent Accountability Commission, shortcoming in parliamentary control over military sector and little interest by Parliament in supporting the Executive's foreign policy agenda. </p><p>History/Overview</p><p> </p><p>This project was launched after the completion of Pakistan’s 13th National Assembly’s first ever 5 year term under a civilian President and an elected National Assembly, on March 16 2013. The aim of the project was to provide a different piece of the puzzle to the story of unsatisfactory performance results in its annual report. PILDAT implemented the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s Evaluating Parliament: a Self-Assessment ToolKit for Parliaments which offers different mechanisms and experiments to evaluate: </p><ol><li>The representativeness of parliament</li><li>Parliamentary oversight over the executive</li><li>Parliament’s legislative capcity</li><li>The transparency and accessibility of parliament</li><li>The accountability of parliament, and finally</li><li>Parliament’s involvement in international policy</li></ol><p>The organization relies heavily on the standards for representative democracy and conceptual frameworks for measuring healthy democratic governance  established by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). The IPU's work focuses on creating greater reflexive dialogue between parliaments across borders, between parliaments and citizens and within parliaments.</p><p>The project covers the period of March 17 2008 to March 16 2013. Working off of IPU’s framework, PILDAT created a ScoreCard to evaluate the Assembly’s representativeness, accountability, transparency, accessibility and effectiveness.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>This project was funded by PILDAT. The project received no funding support from Legislative Secretariats, MPs on national or provincial level. The Score Card questionnaire and the project itself was inspired and instituted in and through the performance measurement evaluation toolkits created by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The evaluation was completed by a diverse group of former members of the National Assembly from various political parties, journalists who cover National Assembly proceedings and key analysts from different fields. The group consisted of 11 former MNAs from the 13th National Assembly and 21 non-parliamentarians consisting of news reporters for major news organizations, former judges, CEO of the Family Planning Association of Pakistan, former Foreign Secretary, Managing Director of Lahore Stock Exchange among others.The participants were selected by PILDAT as representatives of civil society, as well as experts on parliamentary reform.</p><h3>Method</h3><p>The project was implemented through a Scorecard questionnaire developed by the Interparliamentary Union. The toolkit mentions 6 ficitional scenarios of evaluaiton, one of which is the parliament is assessed by an NGO or think tank.</p><strong>Deliberations and Decisions </strong><p>A power point presentation by Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan,Faisal Karim Kundi, created on October 22, 2009, notes that  PILDAT initiated the process \"by taking Assembly  leadership into confidence & requesting him to be a part of the evaluation group\" and that there was \"Broad-based participation due to Multi-party   legislators\".</p><p>The ScoreCard, designed by IPU, was distributed to a group of MPs and Citizens’ groups with the aim of capturing the citizen’ perspective on parliamentary performance and builing a relationship between legislators and citizens in the reform process. The scorecard has four vital parts:</p><ol><li>How to use the toolkit</li><li>Pre-evaluation checklist</li><li>Questions</li><li>Annexes</li></ol><p>The pre-evaluation checklist for organizers asks them to clarify process, aims and participants of the project, as well their vision for how to use the results and the timeframe for output. The performance evaluation is then calculated from the Score Card’s and scores are based on the value judgment of an Evaluation Group consisting of multi-party members of the Assembly being evaluated, journalists who cover the proceedings of an Assembly and analysts who keep their eyes on the performance of the Assembly.</p><p>In particular, those who completed the Scorecard include: 28 – member group assembled to evaluate; 14 Parliamentarians from 5 political parties or groups; 2 veteran parliamentary reporters; 3 senior academics; ;2 senior journalists ;2 lawyers; ;1 former military commander ;2 PILDAT staff. </p><p>The method of evaluation requires participants to answer questions that relate to the nature and work of the legislature. The ScoreCard has 44 questions in 6 different topics. These questions, 44 in total and covering the sub-areas mentioned above and are answered on a scale of 1-5, with 1 as the minimum and 5 as the maximum score. PILDAT averaged the scores assigned by the Evaluation Group and converted them in percentages.The Annexes section includes a definition criteria of representatives, fairness etc. in parliamentary procedures, a lined section for qualitative commentary in essay format on questions that can not be included in the 1-5 scale and a final section to include written commentary on proposed reforms, critiques beyond the questions.</p><p>The questions are organized under comprehensive sub-areas under each of the six topics. For example, the category of representativeness includes measures for:</p><ol><li>Diversity of representation</li><li>Women’s representation</li><li>Representation of marginalized groups and regions</li><li>Electability of a person of average means</li><li>Internal party arrangements to ensure balanced representations,</li><li>Freedom to the opposition</li><li>Infrastructure of the National Assembly of Pakistan</li><li>Freedom and security for dissenting members and finally</li><li>Assembly’s effectiveness for debate on questions of public concern</li></ol><p>The reports of the results were then published and sent to media, government, legislative leadership and MPs through a roundtable discussion and online. The roundtable discussion consisted of the group meeting in a conference room setting and discussing the process, the questions and the results.</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>Critical outcomes achieved through this project include the introduction of a collaborative approach to performance measurement, as well as creating another platform to empower the voice of citizens’ groups in legislative reforms beyond the electoral platform.  The process itself is also educative and helps citizens learn more about the inner mechanics of parliament, inspires communication and self-reflexivity between MPs and provides facts, numbers and data to help citizen’s establish fact-based critiques of government performance. In terms of the data, the 13th National Assembly achieved an overall score of 49%, 53% score for transparency, legislative capacity and representativeness and 41% score for both effectiveness in foreign policy and accountability. The powerpoint by the Deputy Speaker notes that the following policy and parliamentary reform reccomendations were calculated:</p>1.Election Spending Limits be strictly enforced2.Make Parliament’s role effective in Budget Process3.Parliament should scrutinise key appointments4.Provide adequate and non-partisan research service5.Institute system of public consultation6.Attract young people to work in the Parliament7.Involve citizens in legislative process8.Institute a system to check members’ conflict of interest9.Adequate oversight on funding to parties & candidates10.Institute a system to monitor levels of public confidence11.Parliamentary Committees on Foreign Affairs be more pro-active<h3>Criticism and Analysis</h3><p>Though the project and PILDAT's rhetoric claims to capture the citizens’ perspective, its definition and selection of citizen participants is quite thin and applies only to elite members of media, business and the Judiciary. Instead of the citizens’ perspective, the project lays greater claim to engaging elite members of civil society, members of parliament and senior bureacrats.. The project organizers do not clarify the significance of collecting the parliamentary evaluations of former MNAs, as citizens, versus current MNAs. The roundtable discussion also proved to be a successful opportunity for MPs to become answerable for their performance measurements to the media, each other and other members of civil society.</p><p>A vocal critic of the project's results and its use of the ScoreCard method to measure parliamentary performance is the National Democratic Foundation (NDF).NDF argues that the methodology could've been more \"scientifically sound\". It published a review of their report which could not be found on their website. </p><p>External Links and Resources</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/56141262721/pildat-performance-monitoring-of-national\">http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/56141262721/pildat-performance-mo...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/pdf/publications/self-e.pdf\">http://www.ipu.org/pdf/publications/self-e.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.pildat.org/publications/publication/Democracy&LegStr/Performanceofthe13thNationalAssemblyofPakistan-The3rdYear-CitizensReport.pdf\">http://www.pildat.org/publications/publication/Democracy&LegStr/Performa...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2241.htm\">http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2241.htm</a></p><p><a href=\"http://dailytimes.com.pk/islamabad/05-May-16/pildats-scorecard-on-federal-govt-marked-substandard\">http://dailytimes.com.pk/islamabad/05-May-16/pildats-scorecard-on-federa...</a></p>","title":"Performance Monitoring of Pakistan's National Assembly from the Citizens’ Perspective","language":"en","case_id":4490,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T18:51:53-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4481,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)","communication_mode":"Dialogue","communication_with_audience":"Traditional Media (i.e. television, radio, newspapers)","content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":"Not Applicable","end_date":null,"facetoface_online_or_both":"facetoface","facilitated":"Yes","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":null,"post_date":"2016-07-17T11:25:42.000Z","published":true,"start_date":null,"total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T01:48:51.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"General Public","kind_of_influence":"Other","targeted_participants_public_role":"Experts (e.g. Scientists, Engineers, Criminologists, Doctors, Lawyers)","targeted_audience":"Appointed Public Servants (e.g. bureaucrats)","participant_selection":"Appointment","specific_topic":"fair elections","staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_implementing_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_sponsoring_entity":"International Organization","who_else_supported_the_initiative":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":4487,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"33° 43' 45.7968\" N","longitude":"73° 5' 35.3256\" E"},"lead_image":{"url":"meeting7.jpg","title":null,"size":null},"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["elections","democratic accountability","forums","deliberation","experts"],"body":"<h3>Problem</h3><p>Local and international communities heavily criticized the results of the 2002 general election of Pakistan and organizations as not only rigged, but also, unduly influenced by the military’s stronghold on public infrastructure and government.  The Electoral Commission of Pakistan, as well as other watchdog not-for-profit and international organizations, usually conducts short-term, episodic studies of electoral fairness on the actual voting days. There is little official information available on whether the processes and policies that apply to the events and time around the actual voting day contribute to the legitimacy of the result. The year prior to the 2008 elections, and the introduction of computerized electoral calls, this project focused on exploring problems that could tamper the fairness of the results, well before the actual election date. Some problems with the new electoral calls system addressed by this group include: the inexplicable huge drop in the number of voters; the lack of use of NADRA database for preparing computerised electoral rolls; the ECP's insistence upon not sharing draft electoral rolls with political parties or to provide those online at its website citing “legal” restrictions; the ECP's disagreement with the demand to extend the display period from notified 21 days and the cumbersome and complicated process of registration of new voters or the correction/objection process to those already registered, etc (CGEP Position Paper on Fresh Electoral calls, 2007).</p><h3>History/Overview</h3><p>The Citizens’ Group on Electoral Process (CGEP) was formed by the Pakistani Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) in 2006. Its labours are directed towards the vision of free, fair and credible elections in Pakistan, as well as instituting electoral reform.  Traditionally, Pakistani elections are monitored by regional and international observation teams, which arrive at the sites only a few days before or the day of the elections and then leave. CGEP’s  work begins a year prior to the election date, with a more long-term focus. From providing second opinions on existing policy, to drafting critical commentaries on the procedures of the Electoral Commission of Pakistan, to engaging political parties and civil society in dialogue to address complaints on rigging, the CGEP functions as a community of experts, a watchdog and representatives of civil society. CGEP works to demand political parties respect public mandate, non-interference in formation of new governments by the presidency, by local and foreign elements, restoration of judiciary and institute independent judicial enquiry into incidents of poll-day rigging.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>PILDAT is an independent, non-partisan, not-for-profit think-tank focused on building legislative capacities and conducting research on public policy with the mission of strengthening democracy and democratic institutions in Pakistan. Its efforts are mostly dedicating to instituting a monitoring framework for elected representative and legislatures and facilitating participation of different levels of society in the democratic process. CGEP also partners with the Asia Foundation to fund and publish some of its research projects and reports. Among its list of Programmes includes a Political Research Programme, public legislative forums, legislative strengthening Forums, Policy Dialogue Programme, Democracy Watch Programme and the Youth Leadership Development Programme. PILDAT also assists the National Assembly of Pakistan with their background reports and research work to scr The following is a suggested structure. We recommend users follow these headings to make it easier to compare and analyze entries.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The Group is composed of 25 non-partisan, influential experts chosen by PILDAT with strong work experience and connections to the judiciary, the academy, law, media and civil society who meet on a monthly basis. Members include former Chief Justice Supreme Court of Pakistan, Justice (Retd.) Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, Former Federal Minister, Omar Khan Afridi and President of PILDAT, Ahmed Bilal Mehboob. There is little information available on the website as to whether there is a criteria of eligibility through which new members are selected and whether members are appointed by the leader of the group or by deliberation and voting between members of the group. Most members choose to participate to offer their particular knowledge, social resources and expertise from past work experiences to the collaborative effort of formulating research-based critiques and proposals for electoral reforms.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>The method is simple non-hierarchical roundtable style meetings between the participants which are facilitated by the PILDAT president.</p><h3>Style of Deliberations and Decision Making</h3><p>The group meets monthly, in the year before general elections, and annually in other years. The meetings are structured like a conference between industry professionals in which individuals share and discuss their research, offer policy recommendations and concerns on electoral reform. The meetings end with instructions and content for a position paper, research report or press release that is sent to government officials, media, civil society and academics.  The group relies on mostly media reports on the current politics to inform their decision-making. There is little information on whether the structure of the meetings assures equal participation from both male and female voices, and from all members regardless of professional status. However, after pooling their research, the members work together to identify problems and potential solutions or policy recommendations. The meetings end with instructions, drafts and lists to be published on their website and distributed. It is unclear whether PILDAT workers author the research reports and position papers, or if some papers are authored by the participants themselves. Some participants take the results directly to meetings with members of Parliament and distribute in their own social channels. This model aims to mobilize the social network and capitals of the elites as a critical force on parliament, with many participants well-connected to those in Government. A brief summary of the meeting agendas is also posted on the website to illustrate how the conversations develop into a research report. In some meetings, the group invited regional experts such as Mr.Kingsely Rodrigo from Sri Lanka’s Centre for Policy Alternatives and a teleconference with former Indian Election Commissioner for consultation.  The group also meets regularly with political party leaders to discuss electoral reform, based on its deliberations.</p><h3>Influence and Outcomes</h3><p>A central outcome of the group’s deliberations is the Proposed Electoral Reforms position paper published in 2007 which offers a comprehensive list of demands and implementations for the Electoral Commission of Pakistan to help institute electoral reform for fairer, more accountable elections. This paper played had a huge influence in shaping the critical engagement and discussion on the fairness of the 2008 general elections. This is because their work equipped the public, political leaders and watchdogs with research-based data on the state of the electoral system way before the actual election date.</p><p>CGEP has produced consistent research reports and position papers on electoral reform from 2006-2013. The Groups’s efforts were particularly influential and fruitful in the elections of 2008 where it worked to lobby for a  non-partisan president, an independent inquiry commission for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, an appointment of a new CEC and reconstitution of full ECP, effective use of powers by the ECP, restraint by the political parties, responsibility by the Media, and peaceful conduct by all Citizens before, during and after elections. CGEP has yet to update with new reports since March 2013.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Most of GGEP’s research and advocacy work is contained within interactions with government, civil society and media through meetings, reports and petitions. The group’s power comes from their previous or current professional positions  as experts within different communities. Though the individuals come from different professional backgrounds, they are not representatives of civil society, merely experts with specific knowledge on electoral reform.  All members have an interest of mobilizing their social influence and network to pressure the ECP and government to institute electoral reforms for fairer and more accountable elections in Pakistan and to strengthen democracy.  The group, however, is not a vessel of representation of different levels of society, the people or even different regions. Rather, it is a community of experts who mobilize around elections and use their knowledge and social capital to develop timely critiques and suggestions on the implementation of electoral procedurals.</p><p>The Group also played an important role in the Electoral and Parliamentary Reform Process and  Civil Society in Pakistan project funded by the UNDEF for a period of 24 months. The project began in October 2009 and ended in September 2011, with a total funding allocation of US$250,000. The project focused on  capacity-building of parliamentarians, civil society organizations and media as democratic agents and using the CGEP to highlight the significance of accurate electoral rolls and persuading decision makers to implement electoral and legislative reforms. Most of the proposals by CGEP during this project were incorporated in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, and the ECP in collaboration with the National Database Registration Authority created an up-to-date electoral rolls, as well as a 5 year Strategic Plan for 2010-2014 to prepare the country for the 2013 general election. Some of the proposals by CGEP accepted by ECP include incorporating pictures of voters on electoral rolls, and use of computerized National Identity Cards as a requirement.</p><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources/External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.pildat.org/CGEP/cgepnews.asp\">http://www.pildat.org/CGEP/cgepnews.asp</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.pildat.org/Publications/publication/elections/Electoral_Reforms_2007.pdf\">http://www.pildat.org/Publications/publication/elections/Electoral_Reforms_2007.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/democracyfund/sites/www.un.org.democracyfund/files/UDF-PAK-08-260_ER_Pakistan.pdf\">http://www.un.org/democracyfund/sites/www.un.org.democracyfund/files/UDF-PAK-08-260_ER_Pakistan.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.pildat.org/Publications/publication/Elections/StateofElectoralReformsinPakistan_CitizensMonitoringReport5thQtrDecember2012.pdf\">http://www.pildat.org/Publications/publication/Elections/StateofElectoralReformsinPakistan_CitizensMonitoringReport5thQtrDecember2012.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/pols/pdf-files/2002%20Elections%20in%20Pak%20-%207.pdf\">http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/pols/pdf-files/2002%20Elections%20in%20Pak%20-%207.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.pildat.org/about_expertise.asp\">http://www.pildat.org/about_expertise.asp</a></p>","title":"Citizens' Group for Electoral Process in Pakistan","language":"en","case_id":4481,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T18:48:51-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4524,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Community Development","communication_mode":"or Deliberation","communication_with_audience":null,"content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":null,"end_date":"2016-07-29T07:00:00.000Z","facetoface_online_or_both":null,"facilitated":"No","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":null,"post_date":"2016-07-31T05:59:51.000Z","published":true,"start_date":"2016-07-29T07:00:00.000Z","total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T01:16:18.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"Women","kind_of_influence":"Raise public awareness","targeted_participants_public_role":"Lay Public","targeted_audience":null,"participant_selection":"Open to all","specific_topic":null,"staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"Community Based Organization","typical_implementing_entity":"Community Based Organization","typical_sponsoring_entity":"Community Based Organization","who_else_supported_the_initiative":"Women&#039;s Action Forum","who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":4519,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":"Hyderabad","province":"Sindh","country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"25° 22' 54.3036\" N","longitude":"68° 22' 9.804\" E"},"lead_image":{"url":"13686679_544594709071675_6922927560432828080_n.jpg","title":null,"size":null},"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["feminism","activism","gender justice","community development"],"body":"<p><strong>Problem and Purpose:</strong></p><p>According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, honour killings are becoming an acute social and moral problem. In 2015, 1,096 women and 88 men were murdered, higher than 860 women in 2013, with many cases unreported. Honour killings are when a family, or local community murders an individual, usually women, for acting in a way that challenges the honour of the family. In Pakistan, patriarchal readings of religion and tradition tye the izat (respect) of the women and her behaviour and choices to the honour of the family. Zina (sex before marriage), public displays of \"immodesty\" or nudity and love marriages are often cited as reasons to kill by murderers. </p><p><strong>History/Overview</strong></p><p>In light of the recent murder of popular social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch, the local chapter of Women’s Action Forum in Sindh and the Women’s Democratic Front, a branch organization of the Awami Worker’s party hosted a forum-style meeting to discuss the rise of honour-killings of women and girls in Pakistan. The meeting took place in Khanabadosh Writers’ Café on July 29th 2016.  The meeting’s location is a new café initiative founded by Amar Sindhu, a women’s rights activist and writer from Sindh University.</p><p>On the agenda were the issues of feminism in Pakistan, the problems with the legal system in handling such cases and deconstructing the statement, “there is no honour in honour killing.” The women agreed that a lot of the emotional, intellectual and physical labour of and teaching their children women’s rights to pleasure, voice and consent, as well as unpacking the central role of honour in masculinities in Pakistan. The organization, Women’s Democratic Front-Sindh, also hosts weekly study circles on feminism, socialism and the revolution, which have high attendance rates by local women and community members to continue the conversation.</p><p><strong>Participants</strong>:</p><p>The meeting was open to participation by women in Sindh only. Those invited to the discussion include activists, Sindhi community members, teachers, political party members and social workers. Participants chose to attend the meeting because of their own positionalities as women in Pakistan whose lives are threatened by such patriarchal customs. The participants were mothers, daughters, sisters and wives wanting to raise their sons and daughters differently, to engage the men in their life on the difficult conversation of masculinity and to develop self-care techniques for each other from rigid body discipline, sexual assault and gender violence in the nation.</p><p><strong>Method</strong>:</p><p>The event was a face to face roundtable discussion between members of the different organizations.</p><p><strong>Deliberations and Decisions:</strong></p><p>There is very little information available on the actual content of the discussions, as most of its details are in pictures on Facebook. But, through my own conjecture, it was a non-hierarchical meeting between women of all ages deconstructing the parameters through which honour killings are understood.</p><p><strong>Outcomes and Influence</strong>:</p><p>The main purpose of the forum was to raise awareness and facilitate meaningful dialogue between women on the perceptual and material threats to their livelihood, personhood and happiness in Pakistan. The main outcome of the meeting was not simply that women left more aware of the issues. Rather, the individuals who participated in this meeting took the knowledge back to their own communities, homes, and classrooms. The women who participated in this event also connected to the organization's local weekly study circles for girls and women on gender issues. The event was mostly dedicated to consciousness raising to deconstruct the problem of honour killings and pull it from its root through the strength of the feminine, through education and through tradition. More symbolically, what is important is that this event calls into the present the historic legacy of WAF in the women rights movement as beginning as a contestation against the Hudood Ordinances against zina between two consenting adults to a love marriage. </p><p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The Women’s Democratic Front initiatives and WAF activities of forums, study circles, meetings and demonstrations are all organic examples of activism, community development and feminist movements in Pakistan which are not funded by foreign organizations or government agencies. The coalition of these two organizations predicts the next chapter of the feminist women's rights movement in Pakistan against honour kilings, rape culture and body discipline. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Sources</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WOMEN-Democratic-FRONT-Sindh-Awp-\">https://www.facebook.com/WOMEN-Democratic-FRONT-Sindh-Awp-</a>ناري-جمهوري-محاذ-سنڌ-407853906079090/</p><p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/brother-shoots-sisters-dead-hours-before-weddings-in-double-honour-killing-a7165251.html\">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/brother-shoots-sisters-dead...</a></p>","title":"Women's Democratic Front Forum on Honour Killings","language":"en","case_id":4524,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T18:16:18-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4504,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Health","communication_mode":"Discussion","communication_with_audience":"Traditional Media (i.e. television, radio, newspapers)","content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":"Not Applicable","end_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00.000Z","facetoface_online_or_both":"both","facilitated":"Yes","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":null,"post_date":"2016-07-22T12:37:25.000Z","published":true,"start_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T01:10:44.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"General Public","kind_of_influence":"Develop individual capacities (e.g. skills, learning)","targeted_participants_public_role":"Lay Public","targeted_audience":"General Public","participant_selection":"Open to all with targeted recruitment","specific_topic":"Capacity Building","staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_implementing_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_sponsoring_entity":"Academic Institution","who_else_supported_the_initiative":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":null,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"35° 51' 8.2332\" N","longitude":"71° 47' 13.5852\" E"},"lead_image":{"url":"57877bb04c1e8.jpg","title":null,"size":null},"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["mental health","disaster relief","trauma","capacity building"],"body":"<h3>Purpose/Problem</h3><p>The March 2015 floods, and the 7.5 earthquake in October 2015 left the people of Charum Oveer, a remote village near Chitral, with not only severe damage to local infrastructures and housing and no sources of electricity but also, with severe psychological and physical traumas. The village has a population of 1600, with 140 houses, most of which were damaged or lost in the disaster. Many survivors of the earthquake are now living with PTSD, flashbacks, anxiety, depression, loss of appetite and suicidality.</p><h3>History/Overview</h3><p>Two weeks after the earthquake, Karachi Relief Trust (KRT) sent a mental health worker, a remedial teacher and a disaster response expert to conduct a needs assessment of those affected. In the next few weeks, the organization carried out a telepsychiatry program which consisted of online clinics and counseling sessions through skype with counselors in Karachi for those suffering from trauma from the earthquake. The project is among the first of its kind in Northern Pakistan where the delivery of healthcare to remote regions is being realized through technology, satellite Internet and online clinics. This particular project was focused on conducting preventive mental health activities through their telepsychiatry program. The program will run until August 2016.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>Karachi Relief Trust is a disaster management organization founded in 2005. Most of the project was directed and funded by KRT, with resources help from other organizations. Supernet helped with discounted rates for satellite internet, Buni provided discounted solar panels, the Pakistan Association for Mental Health, Aga Khan University’s psychiatry department and the Aman Foundation’s mental health program Mashal helped with the execution and development of the program.  The program was co-coordinated with Taskeen, a national mental health awareness initiative led by Taha Sabri. Taskeen took lead in developing a mental health response team for the region.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The participant selection process was open to the general public in Chitral, especially those who either self-identified as suffering with trauma, or those who were identified  by members of community as showing signs of mental health issues. Both organizations note that a particular reason for the success in participant recovery and turnout is attributed to the high education and literacy rates in the region. Women, in particular, were keen to seek medical help. </p><h3>Method</h3><p>There were there stages of the project:</p><ol><li>Selection of patients for treatment through medical diagnostics</li><li>Training locals, chosen by community elders, to deliver services</li><li>Two-fold delivery of services by locals and online counselors</li></ol><h3>Deliberations and Decisions</h3><p>Members of the Taskeen conducted 2 sessions, 2 hours each at the local jamaat khana on mental health awareness and crisis prevention that were attended by 160 people. With 60 men, and 100 women (10% of the population), the initial mental health team facilitated and created different spaces for therapy from art, to storytelling to meditation.</p><p>A month into the project, the goal transformed from disaster relief intervention to capacity building to help community members identify and respond to common mental health problems on their own.  The organizations and participants proved that that the assumption that people in small villages will refuse counseling services for mental illness and trauma in fear of being seen as “crazy” was incorrect. Instead, they found that people, especially older women, were very willing and curious to learn and heal.</p><p>18 villagers were chosen by community elders and leaders through a roundtable style forum and word-of-mouth for special training as mental health workers and introduced to basic counseling tools, ways to conduct trauma therapy, screening tools to help with diagnosis and empathy training. It is not stated in the media coverage how  local individuals were chosen and by what criteria of competency. One requirement was that the individuals needed to have personal experience living with mental illness.</p><p>By November 2015, the local newly trained mental health workers had screened 500 people and diagnosed 57 individuals with PTSD or depression. The group of selected patients was then shortlisted for online telepsychiatry sessions in December. Following December, each patient saw a psychiatrist in Karachi through Skype once a week. Some counseling sessions are still on-going.</p><h3>Influence and Outcomes</h3><p>Taskeen’s follow-up surveys show that 70 percent of the patients have improved, 10 percent dropped out of treatment, 10 pc have other underlying illnesses, and 10 pc have showed no improvement. The villagers that were trained to provide basic counseling services, identify those suffering from mental health in the community and raise awareness continue to remain active health service delivery agents.</p><h3>Criticism and Analysis</h3><p>As noted by the organizations, limitations of the program include inadequate infrastructure to offer more comprehensive healthcare for mental health rehabilitation, the remoteness of the village as a problem for patients who need more healthcare like bloodtests from nearby cities and internet connectivity issues. Other limitations included language barriers and inability to treat severe cases of mental health distress</p><p> </p><h3>Sources/External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1215519\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1215519</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.karachirelief.org/whoweare.php\">http://www.karachirelief.org/whoweare.php</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1270809\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1270809</a></p>","title":"Telepsychiatry, Online Clinics and Mental Health Training in Chitral, Pakistan","language":"en","case_id":4504,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T18:10:44-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4514,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Human Rights","communication_mode":"Organized Demonstrations","communication_with_audience":"Policy Recommendations","content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":"Not Applicable","end_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","facetoface_online_or_both":"facetoface","facilitated":null,"voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":126,"ongoing":false,"post_date":"2016-07-27T11:59:52.000Z","published":true,"start_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00.000Z","total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T01:09:06.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"Youth","kind_of_influence":"Community building (e.g. social capital)","targeted_participants_public_role":"Appointed Public Servants (e.g. Bureaucrats)","targeted_audience":"Media","participant_selection":"Open to all","specific_topic":null,"staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":null,"typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":null,"who_else_supported_the_initiative":"Awami Tehreek","who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":null,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"33° 44' 1.5324\" N","longitude":"73° 8' 5.8596\" E"},"lead_image":{"url":"pXqsv5WI.jpeg","title":null,"size":null},"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["civil disobedience","protest","revolution","electoral reform"],"body":"<p><strong>Problem/Purpose:</strong></p><p>The 2013 general elections of Pakistan were faced with serious proof of electoral rigging, judicial intervention and political interference in not only the elections process itself (voter registration, eligibility and results) but also, the National Database and Registration Authority’s fairness evaluation process.</p><p><strong>History/Overview</strong></p><p>Organized by Imran khan and his political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, Azadi (freedom) march was a four month long act of civil disobedience against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the alleged electoral rigging of the 2013 general elections. It began on August 12, 2014, Pakistani Independence Day and was called to an end on December 17 2014 upon Imran Khan’s announcement that the nation needed unity and security after the terrorist attack on Army Public School in Peshawar. The movement consisted of different acts of civil disobedience, protest, sit-ins and inter-city marches and lasted an unprecedented 126 days. The Azadi March itself drew an estimated million participants.  Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri’s political party Pakistan Awami Tehreek offered to echo the motion against the PM Nawaz Sharif by planning a parallel Inqilab (revolution) March at the same time. Imran Khan noted that the primary goals of the Azadi March were to contest the legitimacy of the current government (corruption, electoral rigging etc.). He demanded: 1)resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif from national and provincial positions, 2)electoral reform, 3)end to corruption and the luxurious lifestyles of political leaders, and 4)an immediate election. After many dharnas and jalsas, the march began in Lahore and ended in Islamabad as both protests, staged a sit-in in front of Parliament for 17 days until Aug 31.</p><p><strong>Originating entities and funding:</strong></p><p>The political party Tehreek-e-Insaf, Pakistan Movement for Justice, was founded in 1996 by Imran Khan, former national cricket captain.The party currently is the official opposition to the national government, and in power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on a provincial level. PTI holds about 10% of National Assembly seats and leads a coalition government in Peshawar, KPK. The party aspires to realize an Islamic democracy in Pakistan which honours freedoms, human rights, toleration and social welfare. The political party Pakistani Awami Tehreek (PAT), Pakistan People’s Movement was founded by Canada-based cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, who returned from exile during Khan’s Azadi campaign to lead a parallel march. The PAT joined the march to protest the unjust, unwarranted killings in an earlier Model Town PAT protest by Punjab police officers. Upon Gen. Raheel Sharif’s announcement of the terrorist attack against Army Public School, PAT ended its march after 70 days in October 2015. Funding for both marches and campaign was through the general public and through private donors and party funds.</p><p><strong>Participant selection</strong></p><p>Both protests were open to the general public, women, persons with disability and students from all classes and backgrounds. Individuals participated in desperation for political change, fair and accountable voting practices, and democracy. Mostly, individuals participated to make a serious claim for the resignation of Nawaz Sharif as a symbolic shift in Pakistani politics from corruption, greed and blackmailing to democratic governance.</p><p><strong>Methods</strong>: The particular method of a dharna, used throughout the march is a non-violent sit-in protest, which may include a fast undertaken at the door of an offender such as those conducted by Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Jamat e Islami Pakistan in 1993.</p><p><strong>Deliberation and Decisions:</strong></p><p>Prior to the Azadi March in August 2015, Khan and PTI organized 4 jalsas(demonstrations) from May to July 2015 in Islamabad, Faislabad, Sialkot and Bahawalpur. Qadri confirmed a PTI-PAT coalition in protest, yet separation in political agendas, on August 10.</p><p>On August 14, 2015,  local chapters of PTI and PAT made the journey, on foot, by bike, by bus, to the Nation’s capital, Islamabad. With terrorist threats and the legacy of Bhutto’s assassination, leaders travelled in secured containers. 3 hours into their trek, the government began to block major roads and path with massive containers. On the first day, the Governor of Punjab noted the protestors can travel to Zero Point, but cannot, under any circumstance enter the Red Zone. 6 hours into the protest, the Lahore High Court with a three-member full bench released a nine page order calling the movement’s demands as unconsitutitional. Meanwhile, in Islamabad reports of three terrorists entering the city led the government to declare a state of high alert in the entire city. Throughout the entire journey and sit-in, Khan continuously holds speeches and reminds his followers to remain non-violent and peaceful, and only resist if he is arrested. In his first speech at 7pm in the evening, Khan declares the dharna and march’s aims and his requests for Nawaz Sharif’s resignation and announced protests as a democratic right. He also called for the Election Commission to resign before his arrival in Islamabad and that, electoral rigging is unconstitutional.  The end of the first day of the protest trek leaves PTI protesters still in Lahore.Azadi march arrived in Islamabad at Zero Point on August 16 with may clashes with PML-N workers and protestors along the way. The PTI protestors were pelted by stones by Nawaz Sharif supporters. Upon arrival, Imran Khan, KPK Chief Minister and other political party workers and leaders gave speeches. After a night of heavy rain, Khan left to sleep at his Bani Gala residence due to health concerns, despite assuring protestors he would stay the night, in solidarity with 18 protestors who died in the struggle due to the rain. The next morning, Khan demanded the resignation of Nawaz Sharif’s brother Shahbaz Sharif as Chief Minister of Punjab.</p><p>On his August 17 speech, Khan called for mass civil disobedience his followers, to stop paying utility bills and taxes. This lead Chief Interior of Pakistan, Chaudhry nisar to announce a goodwill gesture on behalf of the government to create two separate committees to negotiate with PTI and PAT. On August 18, the Lahore High Court filed a petition against the marches and Khan’s call for civil disobedience as a threat to democracy to the Supreme Court. Also on this day, PTI Vice Presidence Shah Mahmood Qureshi announced that all PTI lawmaker and national assembly members have resigned and that party has withdrawed from the Punjab and Sindh assemblies as well. The next morning, 46 KPK assembly’s opposition members presented a no-confidence motion against Khan and Pervez Khattak fearing the dissolution of the KP assembly. After announcing that the government will recount 20 constituencies for electoral rigging, the Chief Interior Minister noted that three levels of security will be implemented in the following days: policy, rangers and paramilitary forces and finally, the army. The government hesitated to use force against protestors due to the prominent presence of women and children. On August 23, protestors block major entrances to supreme court and parliament buildings denying judges and the Sharif government exits. On August 28, Khan meets with General Raheel Sharif and Qadri, in which military provides political advise and acts as a facilitator.</p><p>August 30 onwards in the Azadi March saw thousands of arrests and violent clashes between all protests from PTI, PML-N, PAT and the police</p><p><strong>Outcomes</strong>:</p><p>In March 2015, to ensure that PTI protests do not threaten the success of the country’s military operations, PML-N  signed an agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding, with PTI, and other major political parties like People’s Party of Pakistan and Balochistan National Party. The agreement, shared publicly in Pakistan Today, promises a three-member judicial commission to be formed under presidential ordinance within 45 days of its first sitting. The agreement notes that if electoral rigging is proven across the country, the prime minister will dissolve the national and provincial assemblies, as noted in the constitution and a caretaker government would be set up in consultation with the leader of the opposition, followed by elections. The PM will appoint a special investigations team, in consultation with the opposition for this task. The protests grew violent with many clashes between media, police and protestors, and multiples cases of police brutality, with at least 33 protestors killed, 113 injured and 3000 arrests. Imran Khan also demanded protestors and participants to stop paying utility bills and taxes as an act of mass civil disobedience. Other leading political parties such as Peoples Party of Pakistan sided with the PML-N and Nawaz Sharif noting that Khan’s tactics were undemocratic and unconstitutional and jeopardized the security situation of Pakistan, with operation Zarb-e-Azb still active and fears of a coup by the military.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Analysis and criticism:</strong></p><p>From serious allegations of excluding religious minorities in the movement, to harassment against women protestors, to economic losses to the country, to internal critiques from PTI members, the mass civil disobedience movement had many flaws. There were also many critiques of Imran Khan’s behaviour as a political leader, as egotistic, non-democratic and power-hungry as many citizens voiced concerns over his populist rhetoric as taking advantage of the country’s poor and desperation. His demands to the government changed with his moods, as seen in the changing declarations and revocation of 48 hour deadlines to the government to respond to his protest requests. The Sharif government’s response to the protest was consistent, with him refusing to initiate violent crackdown of protests. Other consequences of the movement included school closures, extreme levels of littering at protest locations. What was most noteworthy of this movement was its reach in numbers, and articulation of specific claims against corruption and electoral rigging, paired with demands for specific electoral reforms and political actions. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/03/23/national/pti-pml-n-come-together-in-national-interest/\">http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/03/23/national/pti-pml-n-come-toget...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/749704/azadi-march-two-killed-13-injured-in-road-accident/\">http://tribune.com.pk/story/749704/azadi-march-two-killed-13-injured-in-...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/750104/govt-to-form-separate-committees-to-negotiate-with-imran-qadri/\">http://tribune.com.pk/story/750104/govt-to-form-separate-committees-to-n...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://thepakmedia.com/imran-khan-announce-ends-islamabad-sit-peshawar-attack/2014/12/17/\">http://thepakmedia.com/imran-khan-announce-ends-islamabad-sit-peshawar-a...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1125273\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1125273</a></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43717.pdf\">https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43717.pdf</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.geo.tv/latest/74152-imran-qadri-demands-unconstitutional-lhc\">https://www.geo.tv/latest/74152-imran-qadri-demands-unconstitutional-lhc</a></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-azadi-march-imran-khan-to-lead-procession-into-islamabad-s-red-zone-2011958\">http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-azadi-march-imran-khan-to-lead-proc...</a></p><p> </p>","title":"Tehreek-E-Insaaf's Azadi March","language":"en","case_id":4514,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T18:09:06-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4517,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Criminal Justice","communication_mode":"Story-Telling","communication_with_audience":"Traditional Media (i.e. television, radio, newspapers)","content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":null,"end_date":null,"facetoface_online_or_both":null,"facilitated":"No","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":true,"post_date":"2016-07-29T04:39:38.000Z","published":true,"start_date":null,"total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T00:44:35.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"General Public","kind_of_influence":"Raise public awareness","targeted_participants_public_role":"Lay Public","targeted_audience":"General Public","participant_selection":"Open to all","specific_topic":null,"staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"Community Based Organization","typical_implementing_entity":"Community Based Organization","typical_sponsoring_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","who_else_supported_the_initiative":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":null,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"30° 48' 32.58\" N","longitude":"73° 27' 2.9556\" E"},"lead_image":{"url":"1400544_365548520275842_1089907411861077940_o.jpg","title":null,"size":null},"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<p><strong>History</strong></p><p>In 1900, the British Imperial Raj developed a canal system for the agricultural development of Punjab and promised the labourers involved in the project agricultural land as compensation for their work. Some families, settled in Okara were given tenant status and promised full ownership rights within a given period.Though the Okara forests were given to peasants in 1908 by the Raj, the land was under the Punjab Revenue Board’s administrative control and the peasants were ascribed a caretaker role until they receive full rights in 1914. In 1913, under a lease agreement with the Punjab government, the Army took control until 1938, after which the lease was not renewed. In 1947, the Pakistani Army took control of the land, as an illegal trespasser and illegal occupant and has not paid the Punjab government for the produce it has received from the peasants as according to the batai system. The farms on these government-owned lands are operated by different agencies like the military, livestock department and the Punjab Seed Corporation.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong></p><p>After failing to follow through on its 1999 promise to allot land to the landless farmers, in 2000, the farmers began to self-organize and began a campaign to file for legal title to the farms.The next few years saw bloodshed,  police brutality, torture and many arrests, but many tenants still refuse to give up their rights to land ownership under the 1874 Punjab Tenancy Act. Female activists, community members and members of the organization Anjuman Mazarain Punjab held a protest camp for women only on May 20 2016 to demand: 1)release of all arrested tenants, 2)end to the use of anti-terrorism laws to harass tenants, 3)ownership rights for tenants , 4)removal of FIRS againt the tenants and 5)radical land reforms in the province.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong>:</p><p>With the mission of “Malki ya Maut” (ownership or death), Anjuman Mazarain Punjab (Tenant Association of Punjab) is a representative organization of landless tenants on state land in the province of Punjab in Pakistan. The organization works with famers to establish legal claims, protests and acts of civil disobedience to both demand ownership for the peasants and request harvest shares. The organization also works to contest to recent attempts by government to change the tenure arrangement to a contract system to eventually evict tenants (which is prohibited by the tenancy act). Downgraded from sharecroppers to renters, the tenants at Okara Military Farms refuse to pay rent, have staged many protests, to which the army has responded with cutting off water to the fields, sending troops to surround their villages, arrests and torture. In 2000, 7 villagers were killed in clashes between farmers and paramilitary forces. The organization’s most recent work is dedicated to facilitating and arranging Peasant’s Corner Meetings and protests against policy administration to discuss issues affecting local peasants, filing legal claims and solidarity.</p><p><strong>Participants:</strong></p><p>The organization represents nearly 1 million tenants and peasants in over 10 districts across the province of Punjab who work on government-owned farms.The current general secretary of the movement is Mehar Abdul Sattar. Participants choose to participate in protests because their livelihoods and material securities are directly threatened and have little protection or support from formal political avenues for recourse.</p><p><strong>Methods</strong>: The methods employed by participants are primarily protest in the forms of protest camps, sit-ins, and mass demonstrations. </p><p><strong>Deliberations and Decision: </strong>Beyond basic updates on social media, news coverage on arrests and the mission statement of the organization, there is very little information available in en on the official websites and social media platforms (facebook), on the actual details of the events and their realization. Most updates are in the form of storytelling in picture updates. There is not much available information online on what participants discussed, how they interacted with each other, how they took care of each other etc. at the scenes of protest. However, on the Facebook it was noted that the women arranged to meet at a certain point in Lahore, the Shimla Pahari (Press Club) for a sit-in from 11am to 5pm. The protest was gender-segregated, as seen in pictures and there were many men also in attendance. Other groups of women committed to traveling to Islamabad to stage sit-ins. The Facebook event was organized by Sonia Qadir, a representative of the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women. the women and some children set up makeshift camps and held a sit-in as a form of protest.  The protestors also used the twitter hashtag #peasantwomenrising to spread awareness.</p><p><strong>Outcomes</strong>:</p><p>30 women were arrested at the protest camp and 4 men. Exhausting their non-violent measures of political protest, negotiation and voting, the villagers of Okara have yet to have their cases for ownership heard by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. With this said, solid progress in mobilization, consciousness-raising and claims-making has been achieved through the organization and farmers’ advocacy. Their claims, backed by the Okara District Bar Association, are now supported  in coalition with the Lahore High Court Bar Association and the Punjab Bar Council against the district police.In April 2016, legal claims were filed against 4000  Okara tenants were for injuring police, damaging police vehicles, displaying weapons indiscriminately and setting crops on fire.</p><p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p><p>Beyond the case for human rights, ownership rights and human dignity of peasants and farmers, the case of Okara Farms represents a growing resentment over the army’s monopolization of power, land and resources through land-grabbing and military feudalism. The organization, and the contestation by Okara residents, is autonomous, organic and not tampered by paid-rights activism and international development initiatives.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.zklawassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/The-Okara-Farms-Issue.pdf\">http://www.zklawassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/The-Okara-Farms-Issue.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1253058/over-4000-okara-tenants-booked-for-injuring-police\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1253058/over-4000-okara-tenants-booked-for-inju...</a></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/news/2004/07/21/punjab-land-dispute-has-led-deaths-and-torture-hrw\">http://www.irinnews.org/news/2004/07/21/punjab-land-dispute-has-led-deat...</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Anjuman-Muzareen-Punjab-AMP-365546970275997/\">https://www.facebook.com/Anjuman-Muzareen-Punjab-AMP-365546970275997/</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacw.net/article847.html\">http://www.sacw.net/article847.html</a></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1253898\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1253898</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1250041/okara-remains-a-hard-nut-to-crack-for-dist-police\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1250041/okara-remains-a-hard-nut-to-crack-for-d...</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/501280170067596/\">https://www.facebook.com/events/501280170067596/</a></p>","title":"Okara Military Farms-Women's Protest Camp (AMP)","language":"en","case_id":4517,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T17:44:35-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4550,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Gender &amp; Racial Equality","communication_mode":"Dialogue","communication_with_audience":null,"content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":null,"end_date":null,"facetoface_online_or_both":"facetoface","facilitated":"Yes","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":null,"post_date":"2016-08-22T12:11:03.000Z","published":true,"start_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00.000Z","total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T00:38:05.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"Low-Income Earners","kind_of_influence":"Consultation (i.e. to advise decision makers)","targeted_participants_public_role":"Stakeholder Organizations (e.g. NGOs, Neighbourhood Associations, Industry Representatives)","targeted_audience":null,"participant_selection":"Open to all with targeted recruitment","specific_topic":"transgender rights","staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"International Organization","typical_implementing_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","typical_sponsoring_entity":"Community Based Organization","who_else_supported_the_initiative":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":null,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":"Islamabad","province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"33° 44' 1.5324\" N","longitude":"73° 8' 5.8596\" E"},"lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["human rights","transgender activism"],"body":"<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p><p>Despite the Pakistani Supreme Court’s 2009 granting third-gender certification on their national ID and the ability to vote to Khwaja Siras, individuals who self-identify as third-gendered, the community continues to face an excruciating level of discrimination, gendered violence and arbitrary state violence. Some note that the term Khwaja Sira comes from the special position of hijras under Mughal rule as court eunuchs who were able to serve women of the royal family due to their hijra status. The term is more of a professional label with prestige, then a gender. Perceptual violence against the community is seen in the form of stereotyping hijras as beggars, prostitutes, criminals and deviants. According to the national census, which included a third-gender category in 2009, there are approximately 300,000 hijra, third-sex, individuals in Pakistan. Such individuals are often kicked out of homes, beaten, raped and forced into precarious sex work, structural positions and interpersonal situations. Others also face difficulty in finding employment due to harassment, abuse and discrimination. Recently, there has been a rise in transgender murders, rape and disappearances in Lahore, Sindh, KPK and other regions that has pushed the community and activists to mobilize and protest. The Transgender community in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa faces a particularly difficult challenge as displaced from natural disasters and pushed to different cities in the province due to increasing presence of the Taliban. Such individuals are also denied protection by local refugee camps sponsored by international organizations.</p><p><strong>History/Overview</strong></p><p>Trans Action is the first initiative in KPK by and for the transgendered individuals and their safety, livelihood and citizenship rights. The initiative seeks to represent the claims of transgender individuals from 25 districts of KPK and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The project works to mobilize the transgender community through campaigns, education and protest movements in hopes of improving gender identity and gender reassignment equality and their rights and inclusion in KPK. The project also seeks to reclaim spaces for transgender individuals and challenge discriminatory perceptions of such individuals as punishable b y tribal, religious and cultural values. The project seeks to create public spaces for transgender activism, dialogue and consultation. Such protest and activist work places many transgender participants in risk with almost 46 members of the community killed, 1500 others raped and beaten, and 4 threatened by gun violence. Due to such a differential exposure to gendered, sexual violence, a large number of individuals in the community are HIV positive and continue to face threats, blackmail and violence from local gangs. The project’s core 8 members work closely with other transgender communities and activists across 18 districts in the province in hopes of articulating their voice through on platform in the claims-making process.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong>:</p><p>Blue Veins is a women’s rights organization founded in March 1999 and based in KPK dedicated to affirming the dignity of all people. The vision of the organization is a world where every individual despite their sexual orientation or gender identity enjoys the right to and access to healthcare, education and security. The organizations campaigns and initiatives are committed to ensuring women and transgender individuals in KPK have “have full access to the information, resources, training, and employment opportunities they need in order to overcome social, legal and economic barriers, to participate in decision making, and to claim their human rights.” They are the only organization in the region working in coalition and in support of kwhaja sira, hijra communities.</p><p>The organization and its projects are funded by UNHCR, UNICEG, UNDP, British High Commission, German Embassy, Global Fund for Women, Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, Norwegian Human Rights Fund, Mama Cash and USAID. The organization also works closely with local community organizations such as the Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network, Tribal NGOS Consortium, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Working Women Federation and Pakistan Gender Coalition, Student Federation, as well as Khwaja Sira Association based in Lahore.</p><p>The event was organized in collaboration with the Forum for Dignity Initiatives (FDI Pakistan).</p><p><strong>Participant Selection:</strong></p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> Conference style presentations, roundtable discussions and interactive social media boards on issues faced by the transgender community.</p><p><strong>Style of Deliberations and Decision Making:</strong></p><p>The event took place on August 18th 2016 in Islamabad. Community leaders conduced district-level forums and surveys to create an agenda and map the issues faced by transgender individuals in KPK. There is little information available on the structure, details and content of this process on the Internet. Qamar Naseem, the leader of the initiative, facilitated the face-to-face discussions noting the importance kwhaja siras to speak for themselves,</p><p> “I can’t advocate for their rights if they themselves are not interested, because when we did speak out, we’re accused of working on Western agendas,” he says. “We informed their representatives that we were ready support them, both technically and morally, but they had to lead.”</p><p>The only information available online on the events are on the official Facebook page for the Trans Action KPK initiative in the form of interviews with BBC Urdu, transgender community members, activists and leaders, the founders of the initiative and other civil society members such as women’s rights NGOs, elected MNAs and international organizations.  The interviews from the event show such individuals underlining the main goals behind trans-advocacy, calls for electoral and structural reform to enhance citizenship rights of khwaja sira community, as well as increase policing and healthcare efforts to protect individuals. The event mostly consisted of individuals documenting their stories and questions as transgendered individuals to be included within the 2016 national consensus and distributed on social media channels.</p><p>The information included in this case is still in its primary stages and needs more background details on the actual event, the aims and intentions of the participants and the outcomes.</p><p><strong>Outcomes:</strong></p><p>With the little information available on this event, in addition to community-building and raising awareness, what can also be concluded as an outcome is that the recent protest and forum-style conferences hosted by Trans Action Alliance have resulted in government officials promising implementation of Supreme Court rights for transgender individuals. The province of KPK has set aside funds in its annual budget for conducting a census of the transgender community, as noted by provincial finance minister Muzafar Said for 2016-2017. The provincial government has also promised to allocate Rs 200 million for the census and a separate housing scheme for transgender individuals, as well as a special ward system in hospitals to ensure access to healthcare. The local government continues to promise to introduce stronger policy platforms for trans-rights and protection, but has fallen short in backing the supreme courts laws with actual political responses or programs.</p><p><strong>Analysis and criticism: </strong></p><p>The work of Trans Action Alliance maintains a degree of separation from its not-profit roots, as it is primarily a grassroots effort realized by all members of the transgender community, despite class, disability, race or religion. Though funded by a not-for-profit most of its initiatives are designed and implemented by locals and are also critical of donor engagement with beneficiaries as seen in the “No to Gender Blindness” protest against the UN. In this protest, through the project the transgender community mobilized to protest UN efforts and refugee camps refusal to help displaced transgender persons in their disaster relief initiatives.</p><p>The information included in this case is still in its primary stages and needs more background details on the actual event, the aims and intentions of the participants and the outcomes.</p><p><strong>Secondary sources/External Links:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/authorities-in-nw-pakistan-to-conduct-census-of-transgender-people/story-Z5XRK5YAp0Y7QMdn8yFH2K.html\">http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/authorities-in-nw-pakistan-to-conduct-census-of-transgender-people/story-Z5XRK5YAp0Y7QMdn8yFH2K.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TransActionKP/\">https://www.facebook.com/TransActionKP/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/338600-KPK-to-introduce-comprehensive-policy-for-welfare-\">http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/338600-KPK-to-introduce-comprehensive-policy-for-welfare-</a></p><p><a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2016/06/a-transgender-tragedy-in-pakistan/\">http://thediplomat.com/2016/06/a-transgender-tragedy-in-pakistan/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&context=etd\">http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&context=etd</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.apcom.org/2015/12/23/spotlight-khawaja-sira-society-pakistan/\">http://www.apcom.org/2015/12/23/spotlight-khawaja-sira-society-pakistan/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1814950642061645&set=pcb.1814951195394923&type=3&theater\">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1814950642061645&set=pcb.1814951195394923&type=3&theater</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.refinery29.uk/2016/08/120385/pakistan-transgender-women-rape-violence-interview\">http://www.refinery29.uk/2016/08/120385/pakistan-transgender-women-rape-violence-interview</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"https://genderinteractivealliance.wordpress.com/awareness-program/\">https://genderinteractivealliance.wordpress.com/awareness-program/</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"http://www.mangobaaz.com/transgenders-are-people-too/\">http://www.mangobaaz.com/transgenders-are-people-too/</a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"http://blueveins.org\">http://blueveins.org</a></p>","title":"National Multi-Level Stakeholder Consultation  (Trans Action Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)","language":"en","case_id":4550,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T17:38:05-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4539,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Community Development","communication_mode":"Discussion","communication_with_audience":"New Media (i.e. internet, texting, etc)","content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":"Not Applicable","end_date":null,"facetoface_online_or_both":"facetoface","facilitated":"Yes","voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":true,"post_date":"2016-08-13T05:41:30.000Z","published":true,"start_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00.000Z","total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-24T00:06:47.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"Men","kind_of_influence":"Protest","targeted_participants_public_role":"Stakeholder Organizations (e.g. NGOs, Neighbourhood Associations, Industry Representatives)","targeted_audience":"General Public","participant_selection":"Open to all with targeted recruitment","specific_topic":"Housing","staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"Community Based Organization","typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"Community Based Organization","who_else_supported_the_initiative":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":4519,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"33° 44' 1.5324\" N","longitude":"73° 8' 5.8596\" E"},"lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["affordable housing","right to shelter","slums"],"body":"<p><strong>Problem/Purpose: </strong></p><p>Due to severe shortages of available low-income housing in the city, families of laborers, workers and the poor living in Islamabad have established informal settlements, living arrangements known as katchi abadis.  The settlements have existed in Islamabad for 4 decades. The shortage is attributed as a failure by central institutions such as the government, Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the judiciary, to regulate, advocate and protect for the rights of the families to affordable housing. Following the razing (demolition) I-11 Katchi Abadi in August 2015 in Islamabad, Dr.Akthar, President of the Punjab Chapter of the AWP held a seminar “Beyond Evictions: Resolving the crisis of low income housing in Islamabad” in which he attributed the rise of katchi abadis to: 1) lack of political will to create subsidized housing for the working-class, 2) unjust policies of the CDA and, 3)forced mass migrations due to poor state policies, conflict and natural disasters . Many individuals also move to the city to work and are unable to afford housing and so, end up in these settlements. He also critiques the CDA, the main regulative authority, for  not going after those who violate agro-farming regulations and housing authority regulations and only going after the poor in katchi abadis.</p><p> On July 30 2015, the CDA and the federal government destroyed the largest informal settlement in Islamabad, forcing almost 20,000 people (mostly displaced persons/ethnic minorities from regions of FATA and KPK). The government has subsidized many housing projects for communities of public servants, judges and politicians; yet, refuse to comply with Supreme Court orders to allow katchi abadis to exist or provide affordable housing.</p><p><strong>History/Overview</strong></p><p>The most recent illegal eviction took place on August 2nd 2016, of the I-10 katchi abadi.  That morning, CDA, the police, and local land mafia members, demolished the area with bulldozers, without notice, when most residents left for work, throwing women and children out. Some residents showed the police the Supreme Court petition halting further evictions, but were told “we do not accept these here”. The eviction is currently taking place, with 20 homes destroyed, and police and land mafia threatening residents to leave.</p><p>These evictions are a violation of both Supreme Court orders, as well as, neglect of CDA responsibilities for providing affordable housing. The Supreme Court has ordered CDA to register katchi abadis, and their residents and create an affordable housing plan. Scores of residents continue to assemble outside the Islamabad Press Club in protest. The evictions illustrate a war on the poor, religious and ethnic minorities and on human rights by the state, land mafia and corporations. The government justifies such evictions citing threats of terrorist and criminal activity taking place in the settlements. Beginning 2014, surveys, evictions notices and illegal search operations have been carried out after the Islamabad High Court’s order for the removal of illegal settlements ignoring the official national and provincial policies. The National Housing Policy, the National Katchi Abadi Policy of 2001 and other official decisions note that such settlements of 40 houses or more can be registered and regularized when they are formed, and can only be removed or improved upon with a formal resettlement plan in consultation with residents. There has been zero consultation in these convictions, with police and land mafia breaking in homes and destroying or stealing the little possessions of the urban poor.</p><p>In response to this, the All-Pakistani Alliance for Katchi Abadis and The Awami Workers’ Party have joined in coalition to create a community database of the profiles of local residents of katchi abadis, maps of the settlements to help residents in the claims-making process for the Supreme Court.</p><p><strong>Originating Entities and Funding: </strong>Both the Pakistani Alliance for Katchi Abadis and the Awami Workers’ Party are both organic, grassroots, people-centered initiatives.</p><p>Awami Workers’ Party is a political party of the working people which aims to bring together the struggles of workers, peasants, students, women and other marginalized communities in the democratic claims-making process. The party is a coalition of the major leftist organizations in Pakistan, Awami Party, Labour Party and Workers Party in November 2012. Its first Congress was held on Sept 27, 2012. It aims to always work towards becoming a genuine, progressive and socialist political alternative to the material and ideological status-quo in Pakistan. Its current leader is Abid Hasan Minto.The Awami Party’s activities range from from hosting forums on honour killings, land-grabbing etc., to conducting surveys and petitions to help with court cases for accessible housing, to organizing mass demonstrations.</p><p>The All-Pakistani Alliance for Katchi Abadis (APKAA) is an association of slum-dwellers from across Pakistan, formed in 2003, created to protect the rights of katchi abadi residents. The association self-identifies as a nationally-organized resistance to the arbitrary eviction and force homelessness of the urban poor, displaced persons and ethnic/religious minorities. It also advocates for affordable housing for low-income families. Its workers do consciousness-raising and provide social, political and legal education and facilitate peaceful mobilization for housing and land reform        </p><p><strong>Participant Selection:  </strong></p><p>The main participants are those who take the survey and those who conduct the survey. The residents of all the katchi abadis in Islamabad are the survey participants. According to the CDA, there are 52 katchi abadis in Islamabad, exceeding a population of 100,000; only 10 settlements are officially recognized by it due to APKAA’s efforts. As calculated by the Akhtar Hammed Khan Resource Center in 2009, the demographics are mostly ethnic and religious minorities, with 35% Punjabi Christians, 20% Pakhtuns and 10% Hazara/Kashmiri. The residents choose to participate in this community initiative because more information on their profiles, stories and homes will strengthen their case against CDA evictions in the Supreme Court petitions.  The surveys are designed and implemented by AWP and APKAA volunteers and workers.</p><p><strong>Method</strong>: The main method is a community survey dedicated to creating a community atabase of unrecognized katchi abadis and their residents in Islamabad. The process is intended to support the Supreme Courtcase on I-11 on katchi abadi demolition and affordable housing.</p><p><strong>Deliberations and Decisions:</strong></p><p>The organizations decided to conduct their own community surveys because the CDA has yet to follow through with Supreme Court orders in the I-11 case to conduct surveys of katchi abadis for official recognition. The surveys are meant to contribute information to the ongoing case on katchi abadis and the right to affordable housing in the Supreme Court. The CDA continues to use the lack of registration as grounds for eviction and denying official recognition. Thus far, the volunteers for APKAA and AWP have surveyd the Miskeen-Musharraf colony G-8 and G-7. The efforts are in hopes of the CDA never using the claim of inadequate existing records of an abadi in court as a ground to deny residents a right to shelter (as it did in the case of I-11). The surveys also are an opportunity to map needs and issues of the particular communities such as the CDA cutting off water sources to the H-9 katchi abadi. AWP members built a tubewell to provide the community with a water source through a collective community-managed initiative funded by AWP donor Noor Mir and other local supporters. The survey seeks to collect data on unmet needs of the community to file a legal claim that the CDA has failed to meet its constitutional responsibility to provide water, sanitation, housing etc. to residents of katchi abadis. The surveying process also includes regular meetings between residents and community leaders to discuss how to pressure governments to recognize district-level decision-making and delegate power and responsibility to union councils, with 3 AWP members and former residents of I-11 as elected councilors.</p><p>There is very little information available online on the content and style of the surveys and the interactions between participants. However, APKAA regularly post Facebook pictures of each successful abadi surveyed, protests and meetings.</p><p><strong>Influence and Outcomes:</strong></p><p>The greatest result of the Awami Workers’ Party’s constitutional petition against the demolition of the Sector I-11 katchi abadi was the Supreme Court’s order to CDA to create an affordable housing plan for Islamabad’s katchi abadis. However, there has been little to no efforts to heed its request.  The recent evictions of I-10 illustrate this. There is also a growing level of corruption, embezzlement and neglect of land encroachment within the institution of CDA which is halting its capacity to respond to the housing needs of abadi residents. The surveying project has played a major role in raising awareness, strengthening the claims of the residents and organizing coalitional efforts of protest and advocacy for the residents’ rights to housing.</p><p><strong>Criticism and Analysis: </strong>The organic movement, despite its mass efforts at mobilization, lobbying and protest is faced with a serious deadlock in progress due to widespread corruption within the Pakistani political and judicial system. The CDA as a central institution has yet to be challenged by any accountability watchdogs or agencies for its (in)actions and unfulfilled promises.

Inspired by the response on social media, Sadia and her friend, Sabahat Zakariya created a Tumblr called “girlsatdhabas” where they curate photo submissions of South Asian women drinking chai at Dhabas in India, and Pakistan. Traditionally, Dhabas are roadside restaurants or cafes in South Asia, which usually serve as truck stops, and serve chai and Punjabi food. They are mostly frequented by men, and rarely, some women when accompanied by a male relative. The aim of this initiative is simple, reclaim public space for women and challenge the gendered constrictions on loitering. In Pakistan, public space is occupied by a severely disproportionate number of men, with little visibility of women. The page is now run by at least 10 girls form Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi who also plan events and coordinate across cities, with different organizations on raising awareness on womens’ freedom of mobility. Though the founders are hesitant to call their initiative a social movement, they do affirm it as a moment of ownership, empowerment and awareness. When a woman takes a selfie of herself in a public space where she is not allowed entry by social norms, or in fear of “what will people think?” she performs an act of ownership over the space by taking a picture. The founders believe that social media is an extension of public space, and when women see other women appearing in such spaces drinking chai, they are more likely to also go to such spaces and drink chai. There is a deep symbolic value of having a public space to meet with other women and discuss issue over chai, in Pakistani history, revolutions have been discussed over chai. Finally, the initiative is also a call making visible street harassment, and framing it as a human rights violation in Pakistan.</p><p><strong>Originating Entities and Funding:</strong></p><p>It is a grassroots initiative which is mostly social-media based with no official source of funding or affiliation with government or NGO organizations.</p><p><strong>Participant Selection:</strong></p><p>Open to all marginalized members of Pakistani society, with middle-class women in their 20s-30s as most regular contributors. Women from all over South Asia are also beginning to participate and submit entries onto the website.</p><p><strong>Method</strong>: Participants submit basic blog entries to the Girls at Dhaba online website on Tumblr of them drinking chai with other girlfriends without a male companion at dhabas all over South Asia and hashtag it #girlsatdhaba. The entries are then curated and published by the founders.</p><p><strong>Deliberation and Decisions:</strong></p><p>Beyond posting, curating and moderating online content on feminism, human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan, the Girls at Dhaba founders also host and organize other events such as Behenchara Corner, Sleep-ins at parks, demonstrations. All events center in on the demand for making public spaces safer and more inclusive for all, facilitating dialogue on social issues, and consciousness-raising as forms of community development. The Behenchara Corner is a stall they setup at local events like the Women of the World Festival in Karachi, where participants are invited to share chai, to talk and to listen. According to the Girls at Dhabas founders,  “A cup of chai can do a lot. It can facilitate an hour long conversation, it can spark new friendships, it can break assumptions. Making more than one cup of chai is an act of kindness and community building.”  Other events organized include Dhaba Hop!, Girls on Bikes, Vigil for Qandeel Baloch, Monday Mehfil (sharing poetry and art together at dhaba), Meet to Sleep (sleep-in at park), and \"Log kya kahein gay?\" (forum on rape culture at a local park).  Most events of the project invite local women to get together in a visible public space and share stories, art and dialogue on gender justice over chai.</p><p><strong>Outcomes and Influence:</strong></p><p>The initiative was founded in 2015 is now gaining support from all over Pakistan. Girls at Dhabas has also established solidarity and coalitional support from across the border with the Indian campaign of Why Loiter?  The initiative is growing to introduce other reclamation of space activities such as Girls in Parks, where South Asian women coordinate with each other to commit to sleeping overnight in a park. Though such activities seem small or given in the West, in Pakistan, for a woman to sleep at a park, to drink chai at a dhaba, or to loiter in the streets and smoke a cigarette is an act of resistance.</p><p><strong>Criticism and Analysis:</strong></p><p>The founders are hesitant to call their initiative a social movement of its reach and scope. They note that it is still class-privileged and does not meaningfully engage with other intersections of oppression in Pakistan, such as other marginalized members of society restricted from access to public spaces.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/imaansheikh/girls-at-dhabas?utm_term=.lrpoepzy0%23.gxM3M6eGW\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/imaansheikh/girls-at-dhabas?utm_term=.lrpoepzy0#.gxM3M6eGW</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://themissingslate.com/2016/03/24/girls-at-dhabas/\">http://themissingslate.com/2016/03/24/girls-at-dhabas/</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://girlsatdhabas.tumblr.com\">http://girlsatdhabas.tumblr.com</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://muftah.org/girls-at-dhabas-women-pakistan-public-spaces/#.V5bKx0KdLzI\">http://muftah.org/girls-at-dhabas-women-pakistan-public-spaces/#.V5bKx0K...</a></strong></p>","title":"Girls at Dhabas","language":"en","case_id":4512,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-23T16:43:35-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4509,"type":"case","original_language":"en","issue":"Poverty Reduction","communication_mode":null,"communication_with_audience":null,"content_country":"Pakistan","decision_method":null,"end_date":null,"facetoface_online_or_both":null,"facilitated":null,"voting":"none","number_of_meeting_days":null,"ongoing":null,"post_date":"2016-07-25T09:07:01.000Z","published":true,"start_date":null,"total_number_of_participants":null,"updated_date":"2016-08-23T23:35:48.000Z","targeted_participant_demographic":"Low-Income Earners","kind_of_influence":"Develop individual capacities (e.g. skills, learning)","targeted_participants_public_role":null,"targeted_audience":"General Public","participant_selection":null,"specific_topic":"poverty","staff_type":null,"type_of_funding_entity":"International Organization","typical_implementing_entity":"International Organization","typical_sponsoring_entity":"Academic Institution","who_else_supported_the_initiative":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative":null,"location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Pakistan","postal_code":null,"latitude":"28° 29' 26.6388\" N","longitude":"65° 5' 44.8044\" E"},"lead_image":{"url":"BAP-Naseema_01.jpg","title":null,"size":null},"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["Development","poverty alleviation","economic empowerment","agricultural development"],"body":"<h3>Problem/Purpose</h3><p>A UN Inter-agency assessment of Pakistan’s food crisis is that high inflation rates result in malnutrition, increase in healthcare costs, social unrest and higher drop out rates from school because low income families or families with no income have to spend more on less nutritional food. Another issue that underpins this is that Pakistani women in poorer families often have no means of income to change or contribute materially to the family’s maintenance and prevent their children from starving, malnourishment and other security risks.</p><h3>History/Overview</h3><p>The Balochistan Agriculture Project is an initiative organized by USAID and UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization in Pakistan. The project’s primary aim is to help communities and individual farmers increase production, sales and revenues for crops and livestock.In addition to supporting local organizations, the project helps train farmers how to grade, package and market their projects, find  better-paying markets and how to work with buyers and suppliers to increase profits. Another goal of the project is to inspire and facilitate the participation of women in income-earning activities. Its aim activities include training farmers to increase livestock and crop production, develop oppurtunities for 20,000 women, introduce crop varieties and better production technologies and improve irrigation systems. Through such means, the project seeks to increase the incomes of 14,300 households by 20% in 700 communities in the districts of Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Mustang, Quetta, Zhob, Musakhel, Pishin and Sherani in Balochistan.</p><p>The project’s successes range from helping local farmers mobilize, conduct research and find new markets in Pakistan for unpopular crops such as dried mulberries, to teaching local women new carpet weaving techniques, to introducing farmers to mechanical sheep shearing to enter the wool industry.</p><p>The focus of this case study is its kitchen gardening initiative which empowers local women by teaching them how to harvest crops to feed their families. With this vital knowledge, families save more income on groceries and food and women are empowered to take care of their community, family and their own needs. Through this initiative, women are given an opportunity to improve family nutrition and incomes, even within the gendered constrictions within Balochistani society.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>USAID is a US government agency focused on alleviating global poverty and the democratization of societies through sustainable development practices. UN Food and Agriculture Organization is a branch organization of the United Nations dedicated to food security, the eradication of hunger, malnutrition and the elimination of poverty through sustainable management and utilization of natural resources to benefit present and future generations.</p><h2>Participant Selection</h2><p>More than 500 women in three different districts were taught by other local womin studying agriculture how to maintain kitchen gardens and how to preserve and process the fruits of their labour. The participants are both women from low income to no income families and the teachers are locally trained professionals from public universities.</p><h2>Method</h2><p>Groups of women with little or no incomes choose female teachers professionally trained in agriculture and home economics from a local university to teach them how to harvest vegetable and fruit gardens in their own backyards. The workshops are organized by the third party </p><h3>Deliberation and Decision</h3><p>There is little information on the design of the project, how it was implemented, the materials used to teach and how the participants interacted with each other in the workshops. However, insight into one district reveals the general structure of the project. </p><p>In one district, Loralai, 280 women were taught by 5 local women. The 5 teachers attended a 2 -week master training course at an agricultural university in Faisalabad. The trainers were selected by participating communities and usually consisted of women who were literate, and experienced in organizing vocational and health workshops in the region.  There is little information available on the deliberative channels used to choose and match the teachers to the student groups. The community-selected trainers conducted 5 day interactive workshops on planting seeds, using fertilizer, controlling plant disease, and improving seasonal home cultivation, as well as another week of learning canning, making pastes, pickles, jams and jellies as marketable products.</p><p>Media and the organization's website coverage on the project emphasizes its local, organic element, however, there is little information on how the organizations played a role as participants, facilitators and development of the curriculums etc. For example, a local organic movement might focus on different values, reasoning and partnerships for the project as opposed to a development initiative with neoliberal discourse on capacity-building.</p><h3>Influence and Outcomes</h3><p>As a capacity-building project, it not only taught and trained women vital life-sustaining practices for meeting their own needs, but it also, established successful links between them and local markets to sell their output. On a more individual level, though traditionally men take the responsibility of cultivating commercial crops, through kitchen gardening women are growing seasonal produce year-round to diversify their family’s diets, save money and sell their own products for additional income. The project, in its entirety, has accomplished many other development and economic results such as income increase for 11 000 beneficiaries by 40%, 18, 600 acres of land cultivated and the formation of 627 community organizations, among which 227 are female organizations. </p><h3>Criticism and Analysis</h3><p>Because it is a development initiative, the project’s focus is mainly capitalistic, with hopes of increasing the economic productivity of farmers, women and economically-marginalized communities, with little engagement with other intersections of oppression in Balochistan.  A strength of the initiative is that local women are taught by locally trained and connected experts in agriculture. There is little evaluative or critical information available on the project beyond the official websites of the organizations. The project is currently in its performance evaluation stage.</p><p> </p><h3>External Links and Secondary Sources</h3><p><a

(electronic voting) – makes use of the Internet in order to cast a democratic vote. Online voting can be used in representative democratic systems in order to increase voter turnout in local, state or national elections or it can be part of democratic innovations like referendums. Moreover online voting is increasingly used within political organizations. Estonia is the most prominent example of a nation using online voting in parliamentary elections. It was the first country to use online voting in a national election in 2007 and has since incorporated online voting as an optional voting mechanism (besides regular paper ballot voting). The concept of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/liquid-democracy\">Liquid Democracy</a> created around the German Pirate Party is an example of a democratic innovation employing online voting. Different online platforms use the principles of Liquid Democracy by giving users the options to collectively write texts in wikis. Online voting is employed to express approval of alternative text versions. Liquid Democracy also makes use of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/delegated-voting\">delegated voting</a>, making votes transferrable to other, trusted people. Delegated voting (or proxy voting, absentee voting), a mechanism originally used to enable those who are unable to physically move to the ballot (because of sickness, old age etc.) to cast their vote through others, is currently expanding due to the possiblity of online voting.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The overall purpose of online voting is to increase political participation. The use in elections in representative democracies aimes at countering democratic fatigue and apathy. Taking Estonia as an example, there are indicaters – however weak – that online voting might indeed have a positive effect on voter turnout, which has steadily increased at each national election from 58% in pre-online voting (2003) to currently 64.2% (2015). Increasing political participation is also the goal of democratic innovations and new participatory mechanisms in political organizations. Liquid democracy is mainly employed within Pirate Parties as a means to democratize party structures and create new horizontal, participatory political organizations. The idea that online voting can increase political participation is also at the heart of many technotopias of the 1990s, which invisioned an inclusive cyberdemocracy through the means of digital referendums. </p><p>Nevertheless, online voting is confronted with harsh criticism. Online voting heavily compromises the secrete ballot, one of the major priniciples of Western type democracies. If voting processes do not make use of public voting booths but rather take place in private homes, pressure of more dominant household members (mostly men) could be exerted on weaker ones. These worries, however, also affect postal voting. Online voting also opens possibilities for election fraud by governments or other bodies. While developers of online voting systems have generated intricate security systems, none of them can rule out fraud entirely. Once again, this is also true for paper ballot elections. The electronic mediation of elections, however, opens new possibilities for large scale fraud as voting results could theoretically be changed with a few mouse clicks.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Predecessors of online voting can be identified in the use of voting machines, which date back to the late 19th centruy in England and the US. The controversies surrounding online voting today are mirrored in the controversies surrounding this early use of voting machines. In the 1980s developments around the term teledemocracy made voting possible making use of tv sets via teletext. The discussion about electronic voting picked up momentum in the early 1990s through the increasingly popular access to the internet and the rapid development of the world wide web. The USA and Switzerland, relying on their experience in direct democracy, voting machines and postal voting, were among the forerunners of developing online voting. Somewhat surprisingly, Estonia was the first country to employ online voting in national pariamentary elections in 2007.</p><h3>External Links</h3><a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37813811/ICEDEG2015_SwissEVoting.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&Expires=1472040022&Signature=Fzf%2Fu4HC83aGYpoIvo1o7KRo4hs%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DFifteen_Years_of_Internet_Voting_in_Swit.pdf\">Serdült, Uwe, et al.

Unlike those who promote more-consensual community building, community organizers generally assume that social change necessarily involves conflict and social struggle in order to generate collective power for the powerless. A core goal of community organizing is to generate durable power for an organization representing the community, allowing it to influence key decision-makers on a range of issues over time. In the ideal, for example, this can get community organizing groups a place at the table before important decisions are made. Community organizers work with and develop new local leaders, facilitating coalitions and assisting in the development of campaigns.</p><p>Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are democratic in governance, open and accessible to community members, and concerned with the general health of a specific interest group, rather than the community as a whole. Organizing seeks to broadly empower community members, with the end goal of \"distributing\" power more equally throughout the community.</p><p>Community organizing is not to be confused with community development. Consensual community development efforts to improve communities through a range of strategies, usually directed by educated professionals working in government, policy, non-profit, or business organizations, is not community organizing. Community development projects increasingly include a community participation component, and often seek to empower residents of impoverished areas with skills for collaboration and job training, among others. However, community development generally assumes that groups and individuals can work together collaboratively without significant conflict or struggles over power to solve community challenges. One currently popular form is asset-based community development that seeks out existing community strengths. The relationship between community organising and community development is however more one of nuance than total difference. There is much community development literature and practice which is very similar to community organising, see for example the international Community Development Journal. And certainly since the 1970s community development practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses of inequity and power distribution.</p><p> </p><h3>History</h3><h2>History in the United States</h2><p>Robert Fisher and Peter Romanofsky have grouped the history of \"community organizing\" (also known as \"social agitation\") in the United States into four rough periods:</p><h3>1880 to 1900</h3><p>People sought to meet the pressures of rapid immigration and industrialization by organizing immigrant neighborhoods in urban centers. Since the emphasis of the reformers was mostly on building community through settlement houses and other service mechanisms, the dominant approach was what Fisher calls social work. During this period the Newsboys Strike of 1899 provided an early model of youth-led organizing.</p><h3>1900 to 1940</h3><p>During this period, much of community organizing methodology was generated in Schools of Social Work, with a particular methodological focus grounded in the philosophy of John Dewey, which focused on experience, education, and other sociological concepts. This period saw much energy coming from those critical of capitalist doctrines as well. Studs Terkel documented community organizing in the depression era, perhaps most notably that of Dorothy Day. Most organizations had a national orientation because the economic problems the nation faced did not seem possible to change at the neighborhood levels.</p><h3>1940 to 1960</h3><p>Saul Alinsky, based in Chicago, is credited with originating the term community organizer during this time period. Alinsky wrote Reveille for Radicals, published in 1946, and Rules for Radicals, published in 1971. With these books, Alinsky was the first person in America to codify key strategies and aims of community organizing. He also founded the first national community organizing training network, the Industrial Areas Foundation, subsequently led by one of his former lieutenants, Edward Chambers.</p><p>The following quotations from Reveille for Radicals (Alinsky) give a good sense of Alinsky's perspective on organizing and of his public style of engagement:</p><dl><dd><ul><li>A People's Organization is a conflict group, [and] this must be openly and fully recognized. Its sole reason in coming into being is to wage war against all evils which cause suffering and unhappiness. A People's Organization is the banding together of large numbers of men and women to fight for those rights which insure a decent way of life....</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd><ul><li>A People's Organization is dedicated to an eternal war. It is a war against poverty, misery, delinquency, disease, injustice, hopelessness, despair, and unhappiness. They are basically the same issues for which nations have gone to war in almost every generation.... War is not an intellectual debate, and in the war against social evils there are no rules of fair play....</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd><ul><li>A People's Organization lives in a world of hard reality. It lives in the midst of smashing forces, dashing struggles, sweeping cross-currents, ripping passions, conflict, confusion, seeming chaos, the hot and the cold, the squalor and the drama, which people prosaically refer to as life and students describe as \"society.\"</li></ul></dd></dl><h3>1960 to present</h3><p>The civil rights movement, anti-war movements, Chicano movement, feminist movement, and gay rights movement all influenced and were influenced by ideas of neighborhood organizing. Experience with federal anti-poverty programs and the upheavals in the cities produced a thoughtful response among activists and theorists in the early 1970s that has informed activities, organizations, strategies and movements through the end of the century. Less dramatically, civic associations and neighborhood block clubs were formed all across the country to foster community spirit and civic duty, as well as provide a social outlet.</p><h4>Loss of urban communities</h4><p>During these decades, the emergence of an ongoing process of white flight, the ability of middle-class white Americans to move out of majority Black areas, and the professionalization of community organizations into 501(c)3 nonprofits, among other issues, increasingly dissolved the tight ethnic and racial communities that had been so prevalent in urban areas during the first part of the century. As a result, community organizers began to move away from efforts to mobilize existing communities and towards efforts to create community, fostering relationships between community members. While community organizers like Alinsky had long worked with churches, these trends led to an increasing focus on congregational organizing during the 1980s, as organizing groups rooted themselves in one of the few remaining broad-based community institutions. This shift also led to an increased focus on relationships among religion, faith, and social struggle.</p><h4>Emergence of national organizing support organizations</h4><p>A collection of training and support organizations for national coalitions of mostly locally governed and mostly FBCO community organizing groups were founded in the Alinsky tradition. The Industrial Areas Foundation was the first, created by Alinsky himself in 1940. The other key organizations include ACORN, PICO National Network, Direct Action and Research Training Center, and the Gamaliel Foundation. The role of the organizer in these organizations was \"professionalized\" to some extent and resources were sought so that being an organizer could be more of a long term career than a relatively brief, mostly unfunded interlude. The training provided by these national \"umbrella\" organizations helps local volunteer leaders learn a common \"language\" about organizing while seeking to expand the skills of organizers. The Midwest Academy, based in Chicago, provides week-long training in organizing nationally to organizers and leaders who are not part of these established national organizations. The Center for Third World Organizing provides training focused on \"change efforts in communities of color.\" CTWO advocates a process in which those that are most impacted are leading the fight for social change. CTWO offers multiple trainings that provide the tools needed to become an effective organizer.</p><p>The distinction between an \"organizer\" who staffs a community organization and \"leaders\" who make decisions and provide the public face of their groups was increasingly standardized over these years, even in many organizations not linked to \"umbrella\" training groups as the Alinsky tradition became increasingly influential.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Neighbourhood and community organizations are typically open to all and specifically address community members. However, informal hierarchies and exclusionary mechanism might be at work.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_organizing\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_organizing</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><cite class=\"citation book\">Alinsky, Saul (1987/1946).

The Citizen Dialogue method is based on <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning\">Viewpoint Learning</a>'s <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue</a> method. In Citizen Dialogue a randomly selected sample of approximately 20 citizens is given a workbook about a policy issue, and then meets for one or two structured and moderated sessions of a total of 8 to 12 hours in length in small groups and plenary sessions to discuss the policy issue. At the beginning and end of a Citizen Dialogue each participant completes a survey measuring the participant's attitudes about aspects of the policy issue discussed in the workbook. The final survey also contains items about the quality of the dialogue results.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>This participatory method is designed create a channel between citizens and political decision makers to inform the policies of the latter. The use of the workbook enables citizens to shape their political opinion about new policies. The porcess thus enables both input of lay opinion into the political process and the information of citizens of political possibilities (and impossibilities).</p><h3>History</h3><p>This participatory method was first developed as the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada.</p><p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, Canadian public health research and government inquiries identified several problematic issues respecting public health in Canada. These problems included unequal health outcomes among Canadian citizens, the future health of Canada's children, Canadian citizens' nutrition and physical fitness, disaster preparedness and response, and environmental protection.</p><p>In the early 2000s much public debate and discussion of Canadian public health policy took place. Some notable examples of these debate and discussion were the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada\">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a>, the report of the Commission on the Future of Health Care (also known as <em>The Romanow Report</em>), and the 2003 Canadian First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal.</p><p>In 2004 Canada's First Ministers met to consider the state of Canada's public health policies in light of the debate and discussion of the previous few years. The First Ministers issued the 2004 Canadian First Ministers' Health Accord, which called for the development of a \"pan-Canadian Public Health Strategy.\" The 2004 Accord also required  \"governments\" to \"set goals and targets for improving the health status of Canadians through a collaborative process with experts.\"</p><p>To obtain public input on Canadian public health goals the Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned EKOS Research Associates, <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/canadian-policy-research-networks-cprn\">Canadian Policy Research Networks (CPRN)</a>, and OneWorld Inc. to hold the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada (\"Citizens' Dialogue\") in 2005. During the Citizens' Dialogue, which was held in August 2005 in five locations in Canada -- in \"Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Quebec City (French) and Halifax\" -- a randomly selected and representative sample of a total of 102 participants -- with approximately 20 participants meeting in each location -- met in-person and face-to-face to discuss \"public health goals for Canada.\" The deliberation method used during the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada was CPRN's <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizen-dialogue\">Citizen Dialogue</a>.</p><p>After the Citizens' Dialogue had concluded a Goal Statement Working Group used the results of the Citizens' Dialogue, along with input from other consultations with Canadian citizens and experts, to develop a set of eleven draft public health goals for Canada.</p><p>In October 2005 the Goal Statement Working Group held a conference during which these eleven draft Canadian public health goals were discussed. Ten Citizens' Dialogue participants (2 from each location) attended the conference.</p><p>In October 2005 the Canadian First Ministers agreed nine Health Goals for Canada.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Canadian Policy Research Networks.

Please help us complete it.</em></p><h3>Definition</h3><p>Multi-criteria decision analysis is a systematic and rigorous method of analysing and ranking options. It involves considering various solutions to an issue/question/challenge against multiple criteria.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Multi-criteria decision analysis is not exclusively a method of democratic innovation. However, it has been used in policy formulation within governments (see Gov.uk 2009). <a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/\">21st Century Dialogue</a> brought the method to community engagement through the multi-criteria analysis conference, outlined below:</p><p><em>\"A Multi Criteria Analysis is a decision-aiding technique to analyse alternatives to complex problems using weighted triple bottom line criteria that are developed by all stakeholders. The end result is the 'best fit' option.</em></p><p><em>The process is systematic, structured, open and accountable. It engages all key stakeholders with their differing objectives. Both technical data and value judgements are used to reach a preference.</em></p><p><em>The MCA process has four key components:</em></p><ol><li><em>A set of alternative options</em></li><li><em>A set of criteria for comparing the alternatives</em></li><li><em>Weighting to attach a measure of importance to each criteria</em></li><li><em>A method of ranking the alternatives based on how well they satisfy the criteria</em></li></ol><p><em>The process involves four key steps:</em></p><ol><li><em>Preparation and involvement of the community from the start;</em></li><li><em>An initial Workshop of all participants to determine the options and criteria;</em></li><li><em>An Expert Panel to oversee the quantitative data and to rate the qualitative data, with both sets of data being input to a specialised software package;</em></li><li><em>A second Workshop of all participants to weight the criteria according to their importance. Using both the quantitative and qualitative data, together with the value judgement weightings, the computer software determines the best options\" </em>(21st Century Dialogue 2011).</li></ol><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>There is no specific selection method for MCA but in their WA cases, 21st Century Dialogue employed three methods of recruiting participants with an equal split consisting of: stakeholders, a random sample, and people who responded to public notices of the conference. An MCA forum can have 60-100 participants. </p><p>Central to the process is a panel of technical experts on the issue. The role of participants and experts is deliberately kept separate in the MCA process. Participants (the community) develop the options and criteria for them to be weighted against, whilst the expert panel does the weighting. Hart-Karp (2005, p12) argues that this separation of roles is useful in avoiding conflict during deliberation about the proper place of expert vs. community viewpoints. </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCA) is a way for decision-makers (ctizens or otherwise) to weigh up different options. Usually during deliberation, options are weighed up qualitatively, through discussion. MCA enables the weighing of options to be carried out in a more quantitative, rigorous manner. There are several stages.</p><p>1. The first step is to develop possible options or solutions to the issue at hand. This is done during a one or two day forum with participants from the community and stakeholder groups. During this forum, experts makes presentations and answer questions from participants. Participants then use this information to identify possible policy options or solutions. They also develop a list of criteria against which the options will be weighted. The task is to simply define criteria because all options and criteria will be put forward. </p><p>2. Following the forum, an expert panel meets and deliberates in order to weight the options against the criteria. Ultimately, the task of the panel is consider the relative impact of each option with relation to different criteria. For example, during WA's freight network review, 21 possible options and 39 criteria were defined. These criteria were derived from the 'triple bottom line' criteria of economic, social and environmental impacts. Thus the role of the expert panel was to consider the impact of each option on each criterion and give it a numerical score. During this time, the panel are provided with any additional technical information that they require. The process can take several weeks to a few months depending on the complexity and number of options/criteria. </p><p>3. When the expert panel have completed their analysis, a second forum is convened. The same participants from the first forum are invited to attend. During this session, participants review the decisions of the expert panel. Their task here is give different weighting to the criteria ie. rank the criteria in order of importance. Although deliberation in small groups take place, participants individually decide how much weight to give to each criteria.</p><p>4. The ultimate decision is made through computer analysis, once all the relevant information including the options and their relative weighting against the criteria, plus the weighting of criteria, have been fed into the computer. The final option presented is a 'best-fit option' (21st Century Dialogue 2011). The results are calculated and immediately shown to the forum participants to reflect upon. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>The benefits of using MCA are the separation of roles of experts and community participants, and the facilitation of a rigorous, systematic decision-making process. It may be particularly useful for a complex issue where the weighing of options qualitatively may be more difficult. </p><p>However, there are some limitations and challenges to consider. 21st Century Dialogue note that in cases - although participants accepted the final decision of the MCA - they also expressed frustration or dissatisfaction with the outcome. In the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/albany-administration-centre-site-citizens-jury\">Albany Citizens' Jury</a>, Hartz-Karp (2007, p11) notes that some participants felt that others had not been completely honest in their individual weightings, \"biasing the final results in the direction they had preferred at the outset\". This illustrates the disadvantage of private/individual choices vs. open collective deliberation to make decisions. The private element of the MCA resulted in a loss of trust between participants and ultimately, a lack of confidence in the final outcome. In the <a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&action=Link&file=east_west_route_to_freo_port.html\">freight network MCA</a>, although the outcome was accepted by participants, it was not widely accepted in the community and the issue continued to be a contentious and political issue.</p><p>MCA can also become a very labour and time intensive option. In the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/western-australias-freight-network-review\">freight network review </a>MCA, the extent of options and criteria submitted meant that the expert panel required additional time and resources to carry out their task. On the other hand, another MCA conference in WA on haulage routes yielded just two possible options for consideration, reducing the complexity and workload for the expert panel.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>21st Century Dialogue (2011) <em>East-West Freight Route</em> [online], available at: <a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&action=Link&file=east_west_route_to_freo_port.html\">http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&action=...</a></p><p>Gov.uk (2009) <em>Multi-criteria analysis: a manual</em> [pdf], Department for communities and local government, available at: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7612/1132618.pdf\">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/fil...</a></p><p>Hartz-Karp, J.

In contrast with the questionnaire approach used in censuses and surveys, the emphasis is placed on an open-ended enquiry in which local people take the lead.\"</p><p>Toolbox includes:</p><ul><li>\"Social mapping, modelling and transects: enables situational analysis of social structures and services. It helps analyse performance/coverage of existing services and also identifies services that are needed but are not available.</li><li>Natural resource mapping: enables an analysis of the state of natural resources and their use. The dependence of people’s livelihoods on natural resources and the resultant levels of vulnerability can also be analysed through natural resource mapping.</li><li>Well-being ranking: explores people’s perceptions and criteria of well-being, and enables them to use them to categorise individuals and households in their community. This method allows expression of people’s own definitions of poverty or ill-being and also enables them to identify the worse-off and the well-off in their communities. Discussion on how and why households move, or can move, from one category to another is also possible through well-being ranking.</li><li>Network and Venn diagramming: examines institutional relationships, linkages and influences affecting local people, households, and community from within and outside their area. Institutions can include government service providers. The method also enables an assessment of the nature of the affect, i.e., whether positive or negative.</li><li>Seasonal calendars, historical time lines, decades matrix, and daily activity patterns: enables temporal analysis of, and the trends evident in relation to, selected variables. These methods can also enable an understanding of the interlinkage between variables.</li><li>Preference ranking and matrix scoring: enables comparative analysis and exploration of people’s perceptions and choices based on criteria identified by them regarding a range of subjects from resource allocation to choice of employment.</li><li>Cause-effect, flow diagrams for systems, and impact diagrams: examines cause-effect relationships, inputs-outputs, and impact.\"</li></ul><p>From <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/ppa-fata.pdf\">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/f...</a></p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\"Between Hope and Despair\" Pakistan Participatory Poverty Assessment - Federally Administered Tribal Areas Report (2003).

It recognises that citizens are active holders of fundamental rights and not merely passive users of public services. As a result, CBM provides strong evidence to take back to government and, where necessary, into the public domain, in order to better the delivery of services where needed and to acknowledge good service where it is provided.</p><p>Black Sash, a non-governmental human rights organisation in South Africa, has initiated a CBM project, employing a participatory approach to build the capacities of citizens to partner with government to monitor local service delivery. The organisation, formed in 1955, works for the realisation of human rights, particularly socio-economic rights, and promotes open, transparent and accountable governance (see <a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/\">www.blacksash.org.za</a>). As outlined in the South African Constitution of 1996,<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ednref1\">[1]</a> the work of the Black Sash focuses on the right to social security and social protection for the most vulnerable groups, in particular, women and children, who are often the main beneficiaries of government services. They advocate for a strong and vibrant civil society comprised of community-based organisations, non-governmental organisations, coalitions and movements.</p><p>The core of the Black Sash CMB model is the formation of partnerships with both community-based organisations (CBOs) and government in order to strengthen the role of civil society in improving service delivery and holding public and private sectors to account. In empowering communities to participate in CBM, Black Sash is also promoting active citizenship. The CBM project seeks to encourage citizens to appraise the quality of services they receive at government facility level, express their concerns, and engage in dialogues to promote greater community participation in planning, implementation and monitoring of service delivery.</p><h2><strong>Process </strong></h2><p>The Black Sash CBM model involves seven key phases. Some of these phases run concurrently. The starting point is the setting up of infrastructural arrangements with government. Black Sash also creates partnerships with community-based Organisations (CBOs), building the capacity of these Community Partners (CPs) to engage in their own local-based monitoring exercises. Then they work to build a relationship with the local government facility and its managers. Once this is set up, the model moves into the next four phases of monitoring and data collection, analysing and cleaning data into reports, disseminating reports in the communities for reflection in dialogues where improvement plans are developed and adopted. The final phase is that of advocacy.  </p><p><u><em>Phase 1 - Establishing Government Relationships</em></u></p><p>Securing physical access to government departments and their service delivery facilities forms part of the groundwork of the overall monitoring project. Black Sash signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) supporting the CBM project undertaken by Black Sash in selected government departments such as the Department of Health and Local Government (municipalities) and the Department of Social Development. </p><p><u><em>Phase 2 - Selecting Community Partners</em></u></p><p>In this phase, Black Sash identifies community-based organisations (CBO’s) to participate in the CBM pilot project. The Black Sash regional staff schedule meetings with partners across all nine provinces and outlined the project concept, deliverables, timelines, roles and responsibilities. Black Sash takes great care in selecting the correct organisation with which to partner. They select community organisations on the basis of their capacity to engage and implement the project in their respective communities. Selected community organisations are required to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Black Sash. The MoU ensures mutual accountability by specifying the key roles and responsibilities for Black Sash, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the CBO’s taking part in the project. The MoU also establishes a normative framework of values and principles underpinning the overall monitoring project.</p><p>All monitors were also required to sign a Code of Conduct. Each monitor identified the day(s), within a specified timeframe, when they would monitor selected sites in the communities where they lived or worked. The Code of Conduct detailed various character and ethical guidelines, such as the importance of honesty, accuracy in reporting, objectivity, confidentiality, and sensitivity to different languages and contexts.</p><p><u><em>Phase 3 - Engaging Local Facilities</em></u></p><p>This step is about capacitating the local community organisation and supporting them through the local facility engagement. CBO’s are trained on the ethics of monitoring so that they would be able to guide respondents through a questionnaire without invalidating the responses.</p><p><u><em>Phase 4 - Monitoring the Facility</em></u></p><p>Monitoring takes place over a three month period each year and consists of light-touch surveys conducted by trained monitors. Each community organisation endeavours to survey at least 300 respondents per government facility in order to ensure accurate representation. Responses are captured directly onto the system via mobile or desktop tools, or else are transcribed from paper-based forms.</p><p><u><em>Phase 5 - Reporting the Findings</em></u></p><p>This step is concerned with the analysis and packaging of the survey results. Each site is analysed and their results presented back to them by means of high-impact posters which are put up at the public facility to give feedback to their service users. In addition, results are also packaged into a hand-out which is then used to plan the public dialogues with.</p><p><u><em>Phase 6 - Dialogues</em></u></p><p>Public dialogues are a platform for civil society, service users and management of the monitored government facilities to discuss the findings of the annual monitoring and together they will develop and adopt an improvement or action plan to address the concerns raised. This is a collaborative platform, facilitated by the community organisations, from which a joint monitoring committee (made up of community stakeholders and facility management and staff) should be established. The committee ensures the implementation of the improvement plan in the public facilities, particularly in areas where government is not delivering.</p><p><u><em>Phase 7 - Engaging in Advocacy</em></u></p><p>The final phase in the cycle of monitoring is advocacy. In this phase, the Black Sash and community organisations attend to the larger issues that emerged out of the survey results and public dialogues. It is often the case that issues raised at a local level need provincial or even national interventions in order to address the systemic concern. Here, Black Sash also encourages other stakeholders with similar interests to engage with government departments to find practical solutions to the service delivery problems and challenges raised in the surveys.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of the model</strong></h2><p>Community-Based Monitoring (CBM) model is designed to benefit and involve government service users. The model helps to build constructive, democratic state-society relations between officials and community-based organisations who collaborate with community members on monitoring and future planning to improve the performance of public service centres.</p><br clear=\"all\" /><p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\" id=\"_edn1\">[1]</a> Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996).</p><h2><strong>External Links </strong></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dpme.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx\">http://www.dpme.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx</a></p><p> </p>","title":"The Black Sash Model of Community Based Monitoring (CBM)","language":"en","method_id":4357,"authors":[{"user_id":147796,"timestamp":"2016-08-06T22:15:07-07:00","name":"Jeremy Ennis"}]},{"id":4327,"type":"method","original_language":"en","best_for":"Distributing Individual Material Goods","communication_mode":"Express opinions/preferences only","decision_method":"Opinion Survey","facilitated":false,"governance_contribution":"Preference Articulation","issue_interdependency":null,"issue_polarization":null,"issue_technical_complexity":null,"kind_of_influence":"Consultation (i.e. to advise decision makers)","method_of_interaction":"Online Voting","public_interaction_method":"Online ","post_date":"2016-02-29T10:45:59.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":"Regional Government (e.g. State, Provincial, Territorial)","typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)","updated_date":"2016-08-02T19:52:41.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<strong>Citizen Budget</strong> is an innovative online tool used by over 65 cities to broaden their budget consultations beyond town halls and educate residents on the budget process.  Traditionally, governments, schools and other bodies have held public meetings to solicit feedback on their budgets.

Humanity needs to identify the form of the needs, including the decision-making process, and try to satisfy them for its own good.</p><p>Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as freedom, participation, creation, leisure, understanding, identity, protection, subsistence, affection.</p><p>Freedom is most influential for our design. We try to minimize chances for any kind of oppression and be still friendly, economic and transparent.</p><p>Participation is easier, because other needs may be partly satisfied at the event. More opinions could be presented in a private discussion, including taboo and storytelling. We accept cooperation as well as we support the formation of other groups.</p><p>Creation we satisfy by never ending brainstorming. We also show organizers of workshops and seminars their possible audience.</p><p>Leisure we support by comfortable settings, games and number of activities that can be organized in or by the assembly.</p><p>Understanding is better in privacy with less pressure for rhetorics and oversimplification. Assembly is suitable for organizing courses. Courses for more than five people should not happen in the assembly.</p><p>Identity may be provided by working for assembly. Other organizers may develop new identities too. Work for assemblies is also one source of authors identity.</p><p>Protection is provided as assembly and its projects support creation of social ties, that are helpful in case of misfortune.</p><p>Subsistence is not the main focus of the assembly, still it may be helpful for sharing and selling used stuff. Some projects like community gardening still may provide significant subsistence.</p><p>Affection is also a little bit supported. Roles of interviewers and innovators in the assembly may be very helpful for people who seek more affection.</p><p>Issues solved by political science as non-participation, media influence, scalability, language barriers, spam, digital divide, aggression, and authoritarianism are taken into consideration and when posing a significant problem, there should be an attempt to keep satisfying the needs and diminish the problem. Not to get overly concerned about the problem and forget about human needs.</p><h3 class=\"western\">History</h3><p><u><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/spole-ensk-burza\">First t</a>est</u></p><p>Second test in Hradec Králové had no visitors.</p><p>There will be trird test and later development.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Participant Selection</h4><p>Everybody is allowed to come. People from a local neighborhood are expected. The assembly may ostracize, but ostracized may visit another assembly.</p><h3 class=\"western\">Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>First assembly is simplified. Ideas are registered and published to create spontaneous brainstorming. At the same time, common sense is used to place ideas to opinion polls. Opinion polls collect approvals to proposals and ideas within a limited time and return back. Important results are published. For publishing website, flip-chart or blackboard may be used.</p><p>Later assemblies should become spontaneously more complex. Next paragraphs should outline it.</p><p>Ideas should be collected in many ways, for example direct entry to website(e.g. facebook group), most of face-to-face interactions with visitors should ask for more ideas, inboxes,…</p><p>Proposals should be created at the moment when an idea has significant support, because proposals with low support may be discarded from later opinion polls. Every proposal has individual decision rule. Low decision rule may be a cause for low support and legitimacy, because anybody should refuse to support a proposal with low decision rule. (She may also create new proposal with higher decision rule.) To give an advice for creating decision rule, proposals with higher sunk cost should have higher supermajority. Minimum rule is majority rule 50%. One more reason for higher decision rule is a system of decisions, where the higher decision rule, the more legal power. It is necessary to get more legal power to improve or overwrite a previous decision. Also, the decision are aging, e.g. automatically loose 2% of legal power (which is derived from decision rule) per year, because of human maturation, death, and opinion shifts. This should be strong foundation for the search for common ground in decision-making.</p><p>(note to incorporate: The questionaire should allow for more predefined answers e.g. A - yes, it is perfect B - yes D - yes, I will use it E - yes, if you like it  F - yes, if somebody will pay it G - good idea, but make it more detailed L - I do no know this M - I cannot decide N - no response  R - no, too much legal power S - no, decision rule is too low T - no, democratically U - no, I will campaign V - no, I will dissent W - no, I will emigrate X - no, I will fight Y - this system is not suitable for this one Z - I do want fundamental system reform</p><p>If opinion poll is not enough, anybody may request vote. If public vote is not enough, anybody may request secret ballot. If vote is requested, request is published. Moderator announces vote at the moment when is the support in opinion polls for the proposal is peaking above or near decision rule. Participants should be able to see the results on-line in a few minutes. Moderator speaks quite rarely and may be replaced. If secret ballot is requested, some basic form may be organized. Everybody gets a piece a paper and pencil. One after another throwing their papers with yes or else into a ballot box.</p><p>Citizens are encouraged to talk in pairs and small groups. For those who are willing to play, social games may be used to establish new pairs or exchange partners. Pairs may talk about the proposals on information boards or their own ideas. Individual citizens may search public website with accepted proposals from other assemblies and may translate and register them as local proposals. It is recommended to mark translated proposals and get some support before registration or the proposal may be discarded after a few opinion polls.</p><p><br /> </p><h4 class=\"western\">I<strong>nfluence, Outcomes, and Effects</strong></h4><p>Proposals should gradually improve each other, abstract ideas should be accepted first, later more concrete and later maybe even detailed plan with names.<br /><br />The process should produce high-quality decisions by design. The majority of citizens will know the decision at the time when is accepted.</p><h3 class=\"western\">Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>Authoritarians and their followers will probably act against organizers.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Secondary Sources</h4><p><a href=\"https://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/414_05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/414_05.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130319153338/http://www.max-neef.cl/download/Max-neef_Human_Scale_development.pdf\">https://web.archive.org/web/20130319153338/http://www.max-neef.cl/downlo...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://cdd.stanford.edu/mm/2014/luskin-online.pdf\">http://cdd.stanford.edu/mm/2014/luskin-online.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sethgodin.com/ideavirus/downloads/IdeavirusReadandShare.pdf\">http://www.sethgodin.com/ideavirus/downloads/IdeavirusReadandShare.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf\">http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf</a></p><h3 class=\"western\">External Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software</a></p><h3 class=\"western\">Notes</h3><p>The whole event is informal and may be similar to a garden party.</p>","title":"Agora Ekklesia","language":"en","method_id":4206,"authors":[{"user_id":78064,"timestamp":"2016-07-31T13:58:15-07:00","name":"Blake Gagnon"}]},{"id":4241,"type":"method","original_language":"en","best_for":"Achieving Public Goods","communication_mode":"or Deliberation","decision_method":"Voting on discussion board","facilitated":false,"governance_contribution":"Decision-Making","issue_interdependency":"5 - Always Tied to Other Issues","issue_polarization":"5 - Very Polarized","issue_technical_complexity":"5 - Highly Complex","kind_of_influence":"Co-governance (i.e. to share decision making with public authorities)","method_of_interaction":null,"public_interaction_method":"Connection through social networks","post_date":"2015-06-11T00:45:57.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":"Individual","typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"Individual","updated_date":"2016-07-31T09:38:49.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["electoral district forum","conversational democracy","deliberative democracy","e-democracy","online discussion","discussion board","direct representation","digital democracy"],"body":"<h3>Definition</h3><p>An electoral district forum is an online nonpartisan <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum\">discussion board</a> for the constituents of a single officeholder to interact with themselves, and with their incumbent and candidate political leaders.

This is because communications between politicians and constituents mainly go through expensive mainstream media.</p><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To reform U.S. politics to be more inclusive and representative by adding inexpensive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy\">participatory democracy</a> elements.</p><p><strong>Approach</strong>: To move political discourse away from commercial media (both online and traditional), and towards non-commercial online public spaces where it can be more inclusive, accessible, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent\">unfiltered</a> and conversational.</p><p><strong>Method</strong>: To create nonpartisan discussion boards, one forum for each elective office, and then enlist political leaders and constituents to engage with each other there.</p><h3>Theory Background</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/futures/35176328.pdf\">Stephen Coleman posited</a> that effective representative democracy requires that information flow in various channels and offered this appraisal of their status:</p><ul><li><strong>Government to Citizen</strong> (G2C) - takes place largely via the mass media</li><li><strong>Citizen to Government</strong> (C2G) - is limited</li><li><strong>Citizen to Citizen</strong> (C2C) - is the basis of a healthy civil society, but is in decline</li><li><strong>Citizen to Representative</strong> (C2R) - is very limited</li><li><strong>Representative to Citizen</strong> (R2C) - is limited outside of election campaigning</li></ul><p><a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/ecomm/files/Stephen_Coleman_Pamphlet.pdf\">Coleman subsequently surveyed </a>2,273 UK citizens to characterize what they ideally wanted in their relations with their representatives. He found a strong desire for a connectedness, and that they specifically wanted:</p><ul><li>To be heard</li><li>Conversations, not consultations</li><li>Ongoing, rather than episodic, contact</li><li>Honest yet not adversarial discussions</li><li>Representatives to account for themselves</li></ul><p>So in theory terms, the underlying problem the model seeks to address is that communication among citizens (C2C) and between representatives and citizens (C2R/R2C) is too little, too infrequent, and not significant enough.</p><h3>Basic Model</h3><p><strong>Electoral district forums</strong> are online <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum\">discussion boards</a> for the constituents of a single officeholder to interact with themselves, and with their incumbent and candidate political leaders. They are intended to provide inexpensive and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent\">unfiltered</a> channels of continuous C2C/C2R/R2C information flow which are apart from the mainstream media.</p><p>Online civic engagement forums have existed <a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/838/747\">in listserv form since 1994</a>, and discussion boards have existed <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/theslice/confessions-of-an-online-forum-loyalist-in-facebook-reddit-era\">in modern form since 1999.</a> As a result, the community dynamics of online political forums are pretty well known, as are the problems which can arise. This previous experience tells us that certain design features (such as being moderated) need to be present if district forums are to be successful.</p><p>There are a lot of these features, and it requires a few paragraphs to adequately describe them and how they can be implemented in a discussion board. Therefore, the detailed model is presented in Appendix 1 below.</p><h3>Implementation</h3><p>I have put together a fully functional <a href=\"http://www.electoraldistrict.org/pa/senate/index.php\">prototype</a> district forum, using the popular and secure open-source <a href=\"http://www.phpbb.com/\">phpBB</a> software. The prototype is presented in Appendix 2 below, and its code is available upon request. Based on it, a small district forum could be hosted very inexpensively (a few dollars a day) and without any requirements for programming skills.</p><h3>History</h3><p>While many ideas for participatory politics projects similar to electoral district forums exist - see <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en\">Participedia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/11/35176328.pdf\">Promises and Problems of E-Democracy</a> for examples - this specific model has never been tried out before. However, district forums can be considered an extension/optimization of a long-standing internet tradition: the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/wiki/index\">Ask-Me-Anything (AMA)</a>.</p><p>Since their genesis back in 2005, AMAs have become a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/\">mainstream interview format</a> and politicians have recently begun participating in them. Barack Obama did an AMA on Reddit <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_ob\">in 2012</a>, and 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has generated a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8560925/bernie-sanders-reddit\">lot of acclaim</a> for three which he did in 2013-15.</p><p>A comparison of district forum discussions and Reddit AMAs is given in Appendix 3; there are many points of similarity. Given this fact, if a district forum is started up then voters should quickly grasp how they work and what they are trying to accomplish.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Each district forum is focused on a single elective office. Politician participation is therefore limited to the incumbent representative and to any challenging candidates for the office.</p><p>Citizen participation is more open in that anyone can register and get involved. However, many privileges will be limited to district residents. For example, only a constituent will have the ability to “like” a post, and only they will be eligible to propose and participate in conversations with their political leaders. These special privileges will enable constituent views to be separately known, and will afford them greater access to their representative.</p><p>Since forum users' real life identities will be known by the forum administrators, the work required to moderate trolling will be minimized.  However, the use of anonymous usernames will be encouraged to allow citizens to express their political views without fear of persecution.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The internet has revolutionized many aspects of society, but so far its impact on constituent-representative communication has been comparatively minor. Significant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy\">e-democracy </a>advances have occurred <a href=\"http://www.igi-global.com/article/content/76929\">mainly in terms</a> of information provision and delivery of public services. What have been conspicuously missing are advances incorporating dialogue, the core of democratic governance.</p><p>To help remedy this, fostering dialogue is a major goal of a district forum. The importance of unfiltered dialogue, and how district forums make use of it, is further discussed in Appendix 4 below.</p><p><strong>Constituent-Representative Dialogues:</strong> Forum interactions between citizens and political leaders follow a process in order to facilitate written or verbal dialogues. Because there are many thousands of constituents for every representative, discussion and voting are used to identify the questions and questioners the electorate is most interested in.</p><ul><li>Constituents start the process for a written discussion by submitting questions in a “Questions Asked” subforum.</li><li>Constituents discuss and rank the existing questions in the same forum.</li><li>When politicians decide to engage in a dialogue based on a top-ranked question, they create a new topic in a “Questions Answered” subforum. There they repeat the question and provide their answer.</li><li>The constituents who asked selected questions (and only they) are able to post follow ups.</li></ul><p>These written discussions continue until they are terminated by mutual consent, or the moderator concludes they have outlived their usefulness. Many conversations will amicably end after the constituent and representative have learned exactly where they disagree.</p><p>Because there is little time pressure in this discussion format, an unusual degree of scholarship can be exercised. For example, each side can:</p><ul><li>ask for proof that suspect assertions are supported by the facts,</li><li>include visual information like graphs, charts and photographs, and</li><li>ask that the other read and respond to an external document such as an article.</li></ul><p>The same two-step process is used to organize off-line verbal discussions to be held via video-conference, tele-conference, or at a meeting hall. Initiating a verbal discussion would begin with a post in the “Discussions Asked” subforum. Ultimately, video or audio of the completed discussion would be posted in the forum.</p><p><strong>Citizen-Citizen Interactions</strong>: These interactions are more free-form, and this part of the forum is more experimental. The “District Talk” and “Dispatches” subforums in the <a href=\"http://www.electoraldistrict.org/pa/senate/index.php\">prototype</a>provide templates for what citizens could do: post and answer polls, read and write letters to the community, debate issues, etc.</p><p>The size of the district will impact what is practical and useful here. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy#Democratic_reform_trilemma\">small enough</a> district could experiment with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy\">participatory democracy</a> initiatives, or work to build up an <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/Realising%20Democracy%20Online%20-%20in%20_1230.pdf\">online civic commons</a>. The admins/moderators of a large district forum would have to work to prevent the same subforums from becoming an unusable cacophony.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>An electoral district forum's goal is to create new channels for C2C/C2R/R2C information flow. Put less abstractly, its goal is to facilitate some basic democratic actions:</p><ol><li>Citizens publicly discuss among themselves what the community preferences for policy are</li><li>Candidates inexpensively campaign to tell the community how they propose to implement its policy preferences</li><li>The policy preferences of the entire community, not just its wealthiest citizens, are made clear to everyone</li><li>The representative communicates her positions and tactics to the community</li></ol><p>The activity level of a forum can be easily quantified through pageviews, links to it, shares on social media, etc. The forum's impact on its community will be proportional to its activity level.</p><p>The presumption behind the project is that increased levels of C2C/C2R/R2C communication will naturally result in more representative governance. This would manifest itself by incumbent representatives changing their behavior, or by their being replaced by more populist candidates for their office.</p><h3>Criticism</h3><p>1.  One criticism of the district forum concept is that potential participants will be scared off by its novelty.  This can be addressed by beginning with a simple, online implementation of a candidate townhall - something everyone is familiar with.  After users are comfortable with the site, additional subforums and communication flows can be added.</p><p>2.  A second criticism is that the benefits of the forum - increased voter engagement - are too abstract and too long term to attract many users.  To overcome this, it would be very useful to add simple services to bring users in.  One idea is to offer users: </p><ul><li>scheduled notifications of elections in their district, via a method of their choice (text or e-mail) at a time of their preference</li><li>automatic notifications of any changes in their voting registration status</li><li>the ability to let campaigns know that they do not want to be canvassed or robo-called</li></ul>​Users would customize these services by filling out fields in their profile. <p>3. Successful U.S. politicians enjoy a very high degree of job security, along with the prospect of a lucrative lobbying career after retirement. A third criticism is that many incumbents will refuse to participate since it would conflict with their current career path of representing only their wealthy constituents.</p><p>Incumbent non-participation is not just a valid concern, it is pretty much guaranteed to happen. However, there are paths to get a district forum started even without the incumbent on board:</p><ul><li>Challenging candidates interested in a more populist career path may find participation attractive. Their participation should provide enough ‘buzz’ to attract constituents, which would in turn generate pressure for incumbent participation.</li><li>Occasionally there are open races without a defending incumbent.</li><li>Advocacy groups may find forum participation a useful way to get their message out to their fellow citizens, even if the incumbent isn't responding.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, other countries have campaign financing traditions which are less corrupting, and have less of a tradition of a revolving door between public service and lobbying. These countries may be more fertile soil for the concept than the U.S.</p><p>4. A fourth criticism is that participating in a district forum will hurt, not help, a candidate. The reasoning here is that the candidate's posts will provide material which will be spun and put out in a mainstream media attack ad by a non-participating candidate. Weighing against this scenario happening is that:</p><ul><li>attack ad fodder is already plentiful since <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/tracking-the-trackers-what-its-like-to-have-the-most-mind-numbing-job-in-a-campaign/2014/10/14/a2ed9d46-50a0-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html\">trackers</a> often record what a candidate says at public (and even <a href=\"http://newsinmi.com/republicans-caught-using-spyglasses-at-schauer-campaign-fundraiser/\">private</a>) events,</li><li>written posts are less useful than verbal gaffes for attack ads since posts can be edited for clarity after publishing, and vetted by staff before, and</li><li>dishonest quotation in an attack ad is liable to backfire since it is so easy for constituents to click over and read the full context of the misrepresented statement.</li></ul><p>5. A final criticism is that it is extremely difficult to build up a new online community, as is proposed here.  Because very few voters actively seek out information about political issues and candidates, not many will come across their district forums via Google searches.  And if they do find it,  a big barrier to participation is that people don't want to register with yet another website that requires a username and password for them to memorize.</p> Fortunately, district forum communities don't need to be created from scratch, because the discussion board software can be tightly integrated with the existing social networks.  And social networks are ubiquitous - over 85% of U.S. households have at least one active Facebook user, and Facebook is only one of many networks. District forums take advantage of existing social networks with: <ul><li><strong>Social media sharing buttons for every post.</strong> Since many of a person's social media friends are local and live in the same electoral district, sharing will frequently take place. For example, if a forum user likes an asked question and wants to see the representative answer it, sharing the post on Facebook provides an easy way for the user to get it upvoted.</li><li><strong>Easy registration with an existing social media account.</strong> So if a Facebook friend sees the shared post and wants to upvote a question, it takes only one click for them to register to do so.</li></ul><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><ul><li>Democracy, deliberation and design: the case of online discussion forums, by Scott Wright and John Street (2007, <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott_Wright11\">pdf</a>)</li><li>Direct Representation: Towards a Conversational Democracy, by Stephen Coleman (2005, <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/ecomm/files/Stephen_Coleman_Pamphlet.pdf\">pdf</a>)</li><li>Extending the Public Sphere through Cyberspace: The Case of Minnesota E-Democracy, by Lincoln Dahlberg (2001, <a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/838/747\">html</a>)</li><li>Managing Online Forums: Everything You Need to Know to Create and Run Successful Community Discussion Boards, by Patrick O'Keefe (2008, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wD1A5rrD8w4C\">Preview</a>)</li><li>Promise and Problems of E-Democracy: Challenges of Online Citizen Engagement, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2003, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/futures/35176328.pdf\">pdf</a>)</li><li>Realising Democracy Online: A civic Commons in cyberspace, by Stephen Coleman and Jay G.

There are many ways such a concept could be implemented, but knowledge of related projects suggests the following features would help it succeed:</p><p><strong>Focused</strong></p><ol><li>restricted to a single electoral district - to narrow focus onto one geographical area and one political office</li><li>with clear goals - increasing information flow (C2C, R2C and C2R)</li></ol><p><strong>Fair</strong></p><ol start=\"3\"><li>nonpartisan - so everyone feels welcome</li><li>moderated - to keep things civil</li><li>non-anonymous - so people take their posts seriously, but only forum moderators are privy to posters' real names and e-mail addresses</li><li>with disclosure of interests - it must be made clear if someone is posting as part of their paid work</li><li>with limits on user posts - so the conversation isn't monopolized by a small number of people</li></ol><p><strong>Inclusive</strong></p><ol start=\"8\"><li>online - so it's easy to participate</li><li>mainly text based - to keep it simple, inexpensive, informative and searchable</li><li>optimized for searchbots - to make it easy to find content through Googling</li><li>registration via existing accounts - the vast popularity of Facebook, NextDoor, etc., will allow many (&gt;85%) to become registered forum users with one click</li><li>integrated with social media - to foster participation by making it very easy to share posts</li></ol><p><strong>Conversational</strong></p><ol start=\"13\"><li>with an emphasis on dialogue - to prevent uninformative “defense by talking point”</li><li>with dialogue subforums - these will have restricted posting permissions to prevent a cacophony</li><li>continuously run - a continuing conversation, not a one-off or an occasional interview</li><li>with internal communication systems - to make it easy to communicate privately to other users through message, chat or forwarded e-mail</li></ol><p><strong>Useful</strong></p><ol start=\"17\"><li>factual - with fact-checking encouraged since people are not entitled to their own reality</li><li>with “like” voting system - so posts can be ranked by popularity</li><li>with polls - to quantify what the community thinks</li><li>organized with categories and tags - to help find what the community has discussed in the past</li><li>with video discussions also possible - because footage can be much more dramatic and viral than text</li></ol><p><strong>People Powered</strong></p><ol start=\"22\"><li>volunteer run and hosted - so it is independent of outside funding</li><li>simple - so volunteers can moderate or admin without extensive training</li><li>inexpensive to host - to make it possible to be independent</li><li>nonprofit - to focus on community serving and not profit seeking</li></ol><p><strong>Politician Friendly</strong></p><ol start=\"26\"><li>fully open only to district residents - since non-constituent opinions are of limited interest to representatives</li><li>with a reasonable time commitment - staff can write first drafts of responses, only highly upvoted questions need to be responded to, etc</li><li>deliberative - staff can vet posts prior to publishing since there is little time pressure</li><li>correctable - posts can be updated afterwards for clarification or correction</li></ol><p>A standard, open-source <a href=\"https://www.phpbb.com/\">phpBB</a> discussion forum will automatically have features 8, 9, 15, 16, 19, 21, 23, 24, 28 and 29. The remaining ones can be added in the following ways:</p><ul><li>additional software code: 10, 11, 12, 18 and 20</li><li>website rules and organization: 1, 5, 6, 7, 22, 25, 26 and 27</li><li>discussion forum structure: 2 and 14</li><li>forum moderation and norms: 3, 4, 13 and 17</li></ul><h3>Appendix 2: Prototype Software</h3><p>I have put together a fully functional prototype district forum based on the popular and secure open-source <a href=\"http://www.phpbb.com/\">phpBB</a> software. This software is able to handle very large communities - the <a href=\"http://forums.realgm.com/boards/index.php\">largest one </a>running it has over 100,000 registered users and over 28 million posts.</p><p>This screen shot of the prototype's <a href=\"http://www.electoraldistrict.org/pa/senate/index.php\">homepage</a> shows one way in which the categories and subforums could be organized:</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" src=\"http://images.dailykos.com/images/144545/large/pa-senate-electoraldistrict-forum.gif?1432245790\" width=\"600\" /><p>The basic phpBB board has been extended through the use of approved mods and some custom coding. The prototype incorporates most of the desired features discussed in Appendix 1. For example, the prototype software includes both a “like” button for every registered user, and a “+like” button that is only available to district residents. Tallying likes allows the best questions, petitions, etc., to get ranked above the less interesting ones.</p><h3>Appendix 3: Electoral District Forums and Ask-Me-Anythings</h3><p>District forums can be considered an extension/optimization of a long-standing internet tradition: the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/wiki/index\">Ask-Me-Anything</a> (AMA). The format of an AMA is that any registered user can submit questions and vote to rank others. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit\">Reddit</a> is currently the most popular website for this type of interview. The interviewee answers whichever questions he chooses for about an hour, ignoring upvoted questions <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/05/05/martin-omalley-did-a-reddit-ama-it-didnt-go-very-well/\">at his peril</a>. Questions and answers are both short, and there are no follow-ups.</p><p>There are many things to like about this <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/\">new social media form</a>. It is:</p><ul><li><strong>Online and free to use</strong> - so it's easy to participate</li><li><strong>Egalitarian</strong> - no users are privileged above others</li><li><strong>Unfiltered</strong> - no gatekeepers</li><li><strong>Responsive to good ideas</strong> - questions and suggestions are ranked by voting</li><li><strong>Moderated</strong> - which keeps things civil</li><li><strong>Nonpartisan</strong> - so everyone feels welcome</li><li><strong>Mainly text based</strong> - which keeps it simple, inexpensive, informative and searchable</li></ul><p>However, while the Reddit AMA format is a good fit for celebrities promoting something, or for Q&As with unusual people, it is a bad fit for constituents wanting to have substantive conversations with their representatives.  Here are some important issues:</p><ul><li>The politician AMAs that have taken place tend to be <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/on-obamas-reddit-appearance/261758/\">dull and unenlightening</a> due to the lack of follow up questions.</li><li>Not many constituents will participate because of the event's brief time window.  For example, nobody living in the relevant district submitted questions to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/433vrw/lucy_flores_running_for_us_house_in_nv4_ama/\">this AMA</a> from a candidate for congressional office.</li><li>Because there is no identity verification, questioners may not be what they claim to be.  An account's comment history can't be used to definitively filter out sock-puppets because old Reddit accounts are openly sold to people wishing to influence discourse on the site.</li><li> Although in principle there is no gatekeeping on Reddit, in practice it happens all the time.  For example, organized users have done it through downvoting (\"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/36xhxc/what_is_brigading_and_how_do_you_do_it/\">brigading</a>\") since the inception of the site.</li></ul><p>For citizen-representative conversations, I believe these important attributes need to be added to the Reddit format:</p><ul><li><strong>Emphasis on dialogue</strong> - to prevent uninformative Q&As where the answer is a talking point, and there are no follow-ups</li><li><strong>Continuously run</strong> - a continuing conversation, not a one-off or an occasional interview</li><li><strong>More inclusive</strong> - let people log in using their Facebook or other social media accounts</li><li><strong>Non-profit</strong> - to keep separate from Big Media, including Big Social Media</li><li><strong>Non-anonymous</strong> - to keep out <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidvinjamuri/2012/09/12/do-consumer-reviews-have-a-future-why-amazons-sock-puppet-scandal-is-bigger-than-it-appears/\">corporate</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks\">government</a> sock-puppets</li><li><strong>Covers a single political office</strong> - to narrow the focus</li></ul><p>When these attributes are included, what results is close to being an electoral district forum as described in Appendix 1.</p><h3>Appendix 4: The Importance of Unfiltered Dialogue</h3><p>Minds work much better when they are open. Unfortunately, people have an innate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory\">tendency</a> to seek out only information which reinforces their pre-existing views. Furthermore, in those important cases where opinion is <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid\">bound up with identity</a>, a straightforward presentation of facts will often be rejected without being considered first. And to make matters worse the most accessible information, that provided by the mainstream media, is <a href=\"http://www.electoraldistrict.org/white-paper/chomsky-challenge.html\">heavily filtered</a>.</p><p>A district forum aims to fight these effects by encouraging participation (active discussion or passive reading) in a nonpartisan forum filled with information and views which have not been pre-filtered by either the user or by the mainstream media.</p><p>Can dialoguing on forums result in people learning new things and viewpoints, and perhaps changing their opinions as a result? Certainly, but the process of opening a closed mind is slow, and one estimate is that it takes <a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/838/747\" title=\" The case of Minnesota E-Democracy\">three or four months</a> of forum participation for users to become receptive to new viewpoints.</p><p>Relatedly, wealthy interests have long used a <a href=\"http://billmoyers.com/2014/01/10/why-conservatives-old-divide-and-conquer-strategy-%E2%80%94-setting-working-class-against-the-poor-%E2%80%94-is-backfiring/\">divide-and-conquer strategy</a> of fanning prejudicial resentment to gain the support of people who are hurt by their policies. However, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hypothesis\">personal contact</a> has been shown to be an effective way of reducing prejudice towards out-groups, even when the contact is <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214004324\">computer-mediated</a>. A recent study <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112000108\">has demonstrated</a> that reductions in intergroup bias and anxiety occur after only two weeks of online interaction.

They are one form of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/online-deliberation\">online deliberation</a>. Further, online consultation consists in using the Internet to ask a group of people their opinion on one or more specific topics, allowing for trade-offs between participants. Generally, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a policy is being developed or implemented, e.g. to identify or access options, or to evaluate ongoing activities. This enables governments to draft more citizen-centered policy.</p><p>As the Internet gains popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy development through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy. The rise of the Internet has given way to buzzwords such as e-democracy, referring to citizen participation in politics, government issues and policy development through electronic technologies and the Internet, and eGovernment, pertaining to providing citizens with government information and services online. Online consultation is an element of these concepts. Through online engagement, government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public as they have a more direct route to citizen opinion via the Internet.</p><p>Countries like the UK, Denmark, Scotland, Canada, the US-state California, and Australia can be considered leaders in the field. These and many other countries are integrating online consultations and engagement using various methods and for a range of purposes. The European Union also utilises online consultations. These complement face-to-face consultations and help to create greater transparency of the democratic process. Online consultations are also increasingly being used by the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN hosts online consultations to allow for more inclusive drafting processes of policy guidelines, reports and strategy papers. The Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (FSN Forum) is tasked with carrying out many of these consultations.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The problem targeted by online consultation consists of representative democracy's division of labour between the electorate and political decision makers. Government officials tend to come from a higher income, higher education strata of society. This renders insights and everyday perspectives of many citizens excluded from legislative processes.</p><p>Online consultations aim at including a wider public in legislative processes, increasing transparency of government activity, and moreover have a learning effect on participants. The main goal consists of making legislation accessible to a wider public and including insights and everyday knowledge from those affected by legislation.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>In principle, most online consultation processes are completely open to everyone who wants to participate. However, governments initiating entities have some influence in targeting certain groups in population by advertising the consultation on websites frequented by certain societal groups. Moreover, some consultation processes might be might only include certain groups, like fora for victims of rape or sexual harassment sharing their experiences in order to influence new legislation in the field.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Deliberation mostly takes place in online fora provided by initiators. Here users can leave comments and react to the comments of others. Other quantitative features might be employed like surveys ranking preferences, or like and maybe even dislike buttons. Voting procedures between several options might also be employed.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Online consultations, like face-to-face consultations or written petitions, are of advisory character. They are meant to inform political decision makers of the public opinion, so they can take a considered decision.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>Online consultations fruitfully make use of new means of online communication to make legislative processes more transparent and informed by public opinion. They can, however, be criticised from various angles.</p><p>First, while striving to include all strata of society and lowering the barrier for participation, the digital divide and digital inequalities show that the Internet might not be the right tool to do so. Several studies show that the people with higher income and education participate more than those with lower incomes and education, men more than women, young more than old, white more than those of other racial backgrounds. Thus outcomes of online consultation are heavily biased.</p><p>Second, as online consultation is only advisory, it is up to political decision makers to make the decision whether to execute outcomes of consultation or not. This might result in \"cherry picking\" with only those outcomes executed that would have been executed anyway, which implies faking participation in order to gain legitimacy.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_consultation\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_consultation</a></p><h3> </h3><p> </p>","title":"Online Consultations","language":"en","method_id":733,"authors":[{"user_id":1895,"timestamp":"2016-07-18T19:57:55-07:00","name":"Alexis Thompson"}]},{"id":560,"type":"method","original_language":"en","best_for":"Providing Social Goods","communication_mode":"or Deliberation","decision_method":"consensus","facilitated":false,"governance_contribution":null,"issue_interdependency":"4 - Often Interdependent with Other Issues","issue_polarization":"3 - Somewhat Polarized","issue_technical_complexity":"4 - Quite Complex","kind_of_influence":"Community building (e.g. social capital)","method_of_interaction":null,"public_interaction_method":null,"post_date":"2012-04-12T00:20:53.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":"Individual","typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"Faith-Based Organization","updated_date":"2016-07-17T20:11:14.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<h3>Definition</h3><p>The term deliberation describes a communicative process with the goal of finding solutions to given problems. Definitions of deliberation vary greatly from very open conceptions that basically include any kind of talk to conceptions that focus on a rational discourse and specific ways of expression. These different notions of deliberation share the idea of the search of the solutions to a given problem. Thus deliberation is always a productive and creative process.</p><p>„Deliberation is actually an imaginative rehearsal of various courses of conduct. We give way, in our mind, to some impulse; we try, in our mind, some plan. Following its career through various steps, we find ourselves in imagination in the presence of the consequences that would follow: and we then like and approve, or dislike and disapprove, these consequences, we find the original impulse or plan good or bad.“ (Dewey 1960: 135)</p><p>Another important feature all definitions of deliberation share is the notion of publicity. The idea of deliberation is linked to conceptions of the public sphere as opposed to private talk. This link also explains why deliberation is a concept mostly discussed in political theory. Here deliberation is linked to the concept of democracy. <em>Deliberative democracy</em> is described as a process of those affected by a decision coming together to discuss the respective matter under conditions of fairness, freedom from domination, equality and reciprocity. However diverse the interests and identities of deliberators might be, they should keep an open mind and be open to opinion change as they perceive the arguments of others.</p><p>Deliberative democracy is best understood in comparison to common conceptions of democracy. The central mechanism of common conceptions of democracy consists of voting. The basic idea is that the will of individuals is expressed quantitatively. The rule of \"one person one vote\" ensures equality, while each can decide selfishly in accordance with his or her own interests. In this cumulative process the majority is decisive: 50 per cent plus one vote wins. In deliberative democracy, in comparison, deliberators ideally talk as long as it takes to reach a consensus. They are oriented towards the common good and thus seek to include the interests of others in their personal decisions. The openness to learning and opinion change enables the deliberators to grow together and overcome differences in opinion and fundamental objections. In the end of this process there are no clear winners and losers but rather everyone wins and loses a little. Ideally everyone wins as not a compromise but a true consensus emerges.</p><p>To understand deliberation one more distinction is key: the one between micro and macro deliberation. Micro deliberation refers to the unmediated conversation between those people affected by a decision. Micro deliberation is thus related to both participatory and direct democracy. Macro deliberation on the other hand describes a large scale communicative process characterized by mediation. Jane Mansbridge terms this the <em>deliberative system</em>: Citizens, activists, journalists and politicians talk to each other. Not all at the same time, but one to the other. They perceive different opinions through newspapers, television and the internet. The political decisions made in the end by office holders are a result of macro deliberation.</p><h3>History</h3><p>One cannot track with specificity when deliberation as a political practice started. On the search for the roots of the practice of deliberation one might start with the ancient Greek polis around 500 B.C. on which all those with citizenship (free men) had the right to gather and deliberate about public matters. This kind of deliberation is later reflected in the deliberative procedures in European and North American parliaments starting around 1000. And one should not overlook the role of social movements in developing deliberative practices. Many features of deliberation, like the notion of freedom from domination and decision making among equals, were key elements of anarchist movements.</p><p>In contrast to these practical experiences of deliberation, the history of ideas of deliberation can be traced with more precision. Some principles of deliberation can be traced back in democratic theory to works as early as Jean-Jaques Rousseau's (1712-1778). His idea of a <em>social contract </em>consisted of people of a polity coming togehter (micro deliberation) and discussing public matters in accordance with the common good. Rousseau's decision making process ended with voting, not with consensus. Nevertheless, most features of deliberation are apparent: unmediated communication in small, decentral units, a relatively equal distribution of wealth, and an orientation towards the common good and thus aiming at consensus.</p><p>The two founding fathers of deliberative democracy, however, are said to be John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas. While Rawls and Habermas did not speak of deliberative democracy (at first) their conceptions of justice, an overarching consensus (Rawls) and a public sphere free from domination (Habermas) inspired the academic discourse that was to follow. This discourse actually started with Joseph M. Bessette coining the term \"deliberative democracy\" in the essay with the same title as early as 1980. Only after the translation of Habermas' The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962) in 1989 did the academic discourse on deliberative democracy pick up speed. Major publication by scholars like John Dryzek, Jon Elster, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson, Joshua Cohen, James Fishkin, James Bohmann, Jane Mansbridge, Iris Marion Young and many others followed.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>The ideal of deliberation has been faced with different kinds of criticism. Realist democratic theorist argue that  a deliberative democracy can never be realized because modern capitalist societies are based on inequality. Deliberation is thus always governed by hierarchies which contradicts the ideal of freedom from domination. In this view a division of labour between leaders and followers is necessary. For the reason of scarce resources democracy can only take the form or representation.</p><p>Difference democrats argue that the ideal of consensus decision making and the orientation towards the common goods carries repressive features. If everyone is supposed to agree on one outcome those with fewer resources in a deliberative setting will feel greater pressure to conform. This inequality in deliberative setting mirrors inequalities and hierarchies in society. Thus marginalized groups like women, ethnic and sexual minorities, older, handicapped and poor people will be disadvantaged by deliberation. While voting secures the same influence by everyone, deliberation gives weight to the strongest arguments. The arguments that are perceived as the strongest will most likely be uttered by those with greater educational resources and rhetorical skills.</p><p>Another criticism uttered towards macro deliberation is that it might maintain the current status quo of inequality. If we perceive the current democratic system as deliberative, than it might be deduced that equality has also been achieved, since deliberative democracy requires equality. Radical democrats call for contestation, public demonstration and social movements activity to challenge the ruling order. Deliberation, in this view, appears reformist at best.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3>Bessette, Joseph (1980) \"Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government,\" in How Democratic is the Constitution?, Washington, D.C., AEI Press. pp. 102–116.<p>Chappell, Zsusanna (2012): Deliberative Democracy – A Critical Introduction, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.</p><p>Dewey, John (1960): Theory of the Moral Life, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.</p><p>Habermas, J.

Kitchen table discussion groups are often used in conjunction with other methods as part of a wider community engagement process, as in<a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/protecting-snowies-wild-horse-management-kosciuszko-national-park-0\"> Protecting the Snowies</a> engagement in New South Wales, Australia. </p><p>During the meeting, participants discuss issues related to a broader project or topic. They may be provided with a guide or set of questions from interest groups or local governments, but there is no formal agenda for the meeting (NERRA 2016).</p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>The aim of kitchen table conversations is to enable dialogue within the community, that is informal and relaxed. Often the discussion is part of a suite of community engagement tools, and participants can receive a guide to the issue at hand, and possible questions they might want to discuss. The conversation can be about something broad like \"what is important to you?\" to a specific question like \"what methods could be used to control wild horse populations in Kosciuszko National Park?\"</p><p>Kitchen table discussions aim to build and deepen a sense of community and explore the range of opinions on an issue. It fosters community organising and can stimulate and nurture public debate: </p><p><em>\"A main objective is to give interested parties an opportunity to learn from and share with each other, create a sense of community, and discuss options and alternatives\" </em>(NERRA 2016)</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Kitchen table discussions are hosted by volunteers who want to take part. In general they are part of a broader engagement process or connected to a particular organisation. Hosts can then invite who they want to join the discussion, generally around eight or nine people (Douglas 2014). It may be a group of friends, acquaintances or family. </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Hosts of the discussion act as a facilitator, providing participants with any questions or information about the topic. They also lay out the ground rules, \"by reminding everyone that there are no right or wrong ideas, and that everyone's contribution is valuable. The host also encourages people to listen, to ask clarifying questions, and to avoid arguing or interrupting\" (Dept of Sustainability & Environment 2013). One person also volunteers as a scribe.</p><p>The discussion can last up to three hours, with the general idea being that everyone has a chance to share their opinions and be heard. Most guides includes 'starters' - either questions or information to help get the conversation going. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Kitchen table conversations have been used effectively in Australia to stimulate community engagement. <a href=\"http://www.voicesforindi.com/\">Voices for Indi</a>, a community organisation in north-east Victoria has used the kitchen table model to encourage residents to discuss issues relevant to their locale. In total 53 conversations took place with 425 participants. Feedback was provided from the individual meetings and led to the production of a <a href=\"http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/v4i/pages/22/attachments/original/1369543725/V4I_Report.pdf?1369543725\">community report</a> summarising the views represented from the kitchen tables on issues of politics and representation and community concerns. The conversations in Indi aimed to redirect attention and dialogue on the genuine concerns of the electorate - as opposed to the agendas promoted by partisan politicians. Following the campaign, an independent candidate won the seat in Indi. Commentators have suggested that the kitchen table campaign played a role in this (Douglas 2014; Peake 2014).</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>Kitchen table conversations have been championed in various academic fields including political science (Peake 2014), history (Abram 2007), health (Norlander et al 2000) and human geography (Kohl & McCutcheon). </p><p>The kitchen table model has the potential to play a key role in a healthy public sphere, contributing to democratic debate through encouraging dialogue and engagement on important issues. </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Abram, R.

Participatory arts, therefore, are forms of artistic expression – through media such as drama, video, and photography – that actively engage participants in the process of making art. This engagement occurs along three main dimensions: (1) production, or the actual “making” of art; (2) decision-making, which determines what type of art is produced, and by and for whom; and (3) consumption (NESF, 2007: 2). Projects adopting participatory arts as a method stress shared ownership of the decision-making process, and their activities often address non-arts agendas, such as generating dialogue (Lockowandt, 2013: 8).\"</p><p>Lockowandt, Mara, “Inclusion Through Art: An Organisational Guideline to Using the Participatory Arts with Young Refugees and Asylum Seekers.” Refugee Support Network. 2013.

If you think you could make it more robust, please do!</em></p><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>Speed dialogue basically involves participants in a participatory process having 3-10 minutes to 'interview' or question a witness or panellist. This might be done in pairs, but usually takes place as part of small group deliberation. Witnesses will spend the same amount of time with each small group and rotate round, like speed-dating. </p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>The ultimate aim of speed dialogue is to enable participants to ask the questions they want to ask, in a focused but relatively informal manner.</p><p>Speed dialogue is best used towards the mid-point of a deliberative process like a citizens' jury or assembly. It is a useful and fun technique for participants to extract the information they want from expert witnesses or panellists. It is best used at the mid-point because participants will likely have begun to identify some key issues they want to find out about, but as yet they have not begun to compile their recommendations or decision yet.</p><p>Speed dialogue may be just one technique of many in a practitioner's toolkit. In a citizens' jury for example, it will likely be one of several methods used throughout the process. However, whole events can be organised around the concept - much like speed-dating. Speed-dialogue events are often about networking or used as a way of bringing different groups of people together. </p><p>Speed dialogue can also be used simply as an icebreaker for groups of most sizes. In its simplest form it just involves turning to your neighbour and introducing yourselves. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The benefits of speed dialogue during deliberation are that it gives more opportunity for more voices to participate. Not everyone is comfortable asking a question in front of a panel or audience. Speed dialogue is a more intimate atmosphere.</p><p>Because talking time is limited, participants may be able to refine their questioning skills to use the time effectively - there is no time to explore tangents in 3 minutes! Speed dialogue can encourage greater focus from participants. </p><p>Speed dialogue encourages greater participation than the typical Q&A format. Often during a deliberative process, participants get information overload and fatigue. Speed dialogue re-injects some energy into the room and can really bring the issue to life for some participants.</p><p>Speed dialogue gives participants a sense of ownership in a deliberative forum. They no longer have to wait for the chair or facilitator to pick their question. Small groups can pursue issues that maybe others in the room aren't interested in. Speed dialogue is empowering.</p><p>It's fun! Experts being interrogated, running from table to table whilst citizens lean into a tight huddle and hone their next question, facilitators ringing bells to signal time - speed dialogue brings energy and a sense of fun to proceedings.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>The Dialogue Society have produced a very detailed pamphlet on planning speed dialogue events:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dialoguesociety.org/publications/community/Speed-Dialogue.pdf\">http://www.dialoguesociety.org/publications/community/Speed-Dialogue.pdf</a></p><h3> </h3>","title":"Speed Dialogue","language":"en","method_id":4434,"authors":[{"user_id":134860,"timestamp":"2016-06-20T06:25:41-07:00","name":"Ryan Côté"}]},{"id":4426,"type":"method","original_language":"en","best_for":"Addressing Identity-Based Issues","communication_mode":"Organized Demonstrations","decision_method":null,"facilitated":false,"governance_contribution":"Preference Articulation","issue_interdependency":null,"issue_polarization":null,"issue_technical_complexity":null,"kind_of_influence":"Raise public awareness","method_of_interaction":null,"public_interaction_method":"Community Organizing","post_date":"2016-06-16T05:28:31.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":"Not Applicable","typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"Non-Governmental Organization (Non-profit)","updated_date":"2016-06-16T05:29:21.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<p><em>Note: the following article is a stub.

Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves.[2] Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.[3]\"</p><p>[2] St. John Barned-Smith, \"How We Rage: This Is Not Your Parents' Protest,\" Current (Winter 2007): 17-25.<br />[3] Adam Roberts, Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 2-3, where a more comprehensive definition of \"civil resistance\" may be found.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p> </p><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>","title":"Protest","language":"en","method_id":4426,"authors":[{"user_id":110904,"timestamp":"2016-06-15T22:29:21-07:00","name":"Emma Bélanger"}]},{"id":4419,"type":"method","original_language":"en","best_for":null,"communication_mode":null,"decision_method":null,"facilitated":false,"governance_contribution":null,"issue_interdependency":null,"issue_polarization":null,"issue_technical_complexity":null,"kind_of_influence":null,"method_of_interaction":null,"public_interaction_method":null,"post_date":"2016-06-07T03:46:09.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":null,"typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":null,"updated_date":"2016-06-07T03:46:09.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["Argument mapping; online tools for deliberation; participatory democracy; wicked problems; conflict management; knowledge presentation"],"body":"<p>The following is a suggested structure.

This is an example of a so-called <strong>wicked problem</strong>. Problems are wicked if they cannot even be clearly stated because there is no agreement about what the problem exactly is. Since we always approach problems from a certain point of view, these problems will be perceived and specified differently as a function of varying knowledge, conflicting interests, world-views, and values.</p><p>The goal of the VIP Digital Deliberation is to design, test, iteratively improve, and implement the online platform <strong>Reflect! </strong>that supports and structures large-scale deliberation on wicked problems and stimulates reflection.</p><p>Here is a list of <strong>challenges</strong> that need to be dealt with to achieve this goal:</p><ul><li><p>Obviously, we feel much more comfortable talking to people who share our views. But this is not sufficient when it comes to wicked problems and the resolution of conflicts. Instead of rehearsing time and again the same opinions, we need to talk to people whose opinions we do not share.</p></li><li><p>Peaceful decision making and conflict resolution are only possible if people are able to change their mind based on the better argument. This again requires to organize deliberation in a way that supports reflection on one's own reasoning. People need to be enabled to identify—in the process of deliberating with others—weaknesses, gaps, biases, and limitations in their own thinking, and they should be supported to improve it.</p></li><li><p>Instead of winning an argument, it is much better to stimulate creativity so that solutions can be found that more stakeholders can support.</p></li><li><p>Participating in public deliberation should be experienced as exciting and rewarding.</p></li></ul><h3>History</h3><p>The Reflect! platform will be built on AGORA-net, a computer-supported collaborative argument visualization tool: <a href=\"http://agora.gatech.edu\">http://agora.gatech.edu</a>.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/new-team-digital-deliberation\">http://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/new-team-digital-deliberation</a></p><p><a href=\"http://agora.gatech.edu\">http://agora.gatech.edu</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>","title":"Digital Deliberation","language":"en","method_id":4419,"authors":[{"user_id":7665,"timestamp":"2016-06-06T20:46:09-07:00","name":"Ryder Abraham"}]},{"id":156,"type":"method","original_language":"fr","best_for":"Distributing Individual Material Goods","communication_mode":"Discussion","decision_method":"Consensus","facilitated":true,"governance_contribution":"Preference Articulation","issue_interdependency":"5 - Always Tied to Other Issues","issue_polarization":"4 - Polarized","issue_technical_complexity":null,"kind_of_influence":"Consultation (i.e. to advise decision makers)","method_of_interaction":"Facilitated group simulation exercise (&amp;quot;serious game&amp;quot;)","public_interaction_method":"Varies","post_date":"2010-05-11T08:44:05.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":null,"typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"Academic Institution","updated_date":"2016-06-06T20:19:20.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<p>“Choosing Healthplans All Together” (CHAT) is a small group simulation exercise designed to give the public a voice in setting health or health care spending priorities.

Cunha, UFMG, Brazil.</p><h3>Definition<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/br92J5A.png?3\" /></h3>Os conselhos de políticas públicas[1] são estruturas político-institucionais permanentes vinculados à estrutura administrativa do Estado brasileiro, em seus três níveis de governo (União, estados e municípios) e relacionados a uma área de política pública. Eles são híbridos em sua composição – representantes do governo, da sociedade civil e, em alguns casos, do mercado – e contam com uma estrutura burocrática de apoio ao seu funcionamento. A lei que institui o conselho estabelece a sua natureza, as especificidades de sua composição, bem como os objetivos e os parâmetros de sua estrutura e seu funcionamento.  <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3>No processo de redemocratização do Brasil, após a ditadura militar (1964-1985), havia uma forte demanda dos movimentos sociais e de diversas organizações da sociedade civil pela ampliação dos espaços e oportunidades de participação democrática e pela possibilidade efetiva da sociedade participar da definição das políticas públicas. Os conselhos despontaram como um dos diferentes espaços que possibilitariam viabilizar a participação da sociedade na formulação e no controle sobre as ações públicas e os resultados de políticas públicas. Eles têm sido instituídos em diferentes áreas de políticas públicas (como saúde, assistência social, meio ambiente, educação, patrimônio público, políticas urbanas) com diferentes finalidades, que podem ser combinadas entre si: consultiva, quando instruem e assessoram os governos em suas decisões; normativa, quando estabelecem normas que organizam a política; deliberativa, quando suas decisões são vinculantes; e fiscalizatória, quando têm poder de monitoramento e controle da política (Buvinich, 2014). Seu foco é a gestão de bens públicos, o estabelecimento de diretrizes e estratégias de ação, a definição de prioridades (inclusive orçamentárias), a regulação e a normatização das ações de determinada área de política pública e o controle público sobre o Estado (Cunha, 2013). <h3>History</h3>No Brasil, verifica-se a existência de conselhos como meio de apoio ao exercício do poder político-administrativo desde o Século XIX. No Império, os conselhos eram compostos por membros da elite intelectual, política e econômica e visavam a conciliar as decisões governamentais com os interesses dessa elite. No início do Século XX, a área previdenciária experimentou processos de participação institucionalizada que admitiram representantes dos trabalhadores, mas áreas como Educação, Saúde, Economia e Finanças, Assistência Social e Indústria e Comércio instituíram conselhos consultivos compostos prioritariamente por notáveis e, em alguns deles, havia representação corporativa ou de interesses privados. Em meados do século os conselhos de âmbito nacional adquiriam características de especialização técnica, como o da Educação, que passou a normatizar a área, definindo aspectos relevantes dessa política. O advento da ditadura militar não só manteve os conselhos na estrutura do Estado brasileiro como ampliou o seu número (de 2, em 1956 para 6 em 1984), mas com fortes restrições na sua atuação, que passou a ter rigoroso controle governamental bem como a supressão da representação dos trabalhadores (Cortes, 2002 apud CUNHA, 2013).Além desses conselhos de âmbito nacional, nas décadas de 1970 e 1980 alguns governos municipais criaram conselhos comunitários para mediar suas relações com movimentos e organizações populares, bem como surgiram iniciativas da sociedade civil, que criou conselhos populares que visavam a estabelecer pressão e negociação com o poder público, além do controle sobre recursos e instituições (Gohn, 2001 apud CUNHA, 2013). A área da saúde, por sua vez, desenvolvia experiências de participação comunitária desde 1979, criando comissões interinstitucionais nos três níveis de governo que contavam com a participação de prestadores de serviços privados e representantes de entidades comunitárias, sindicais etc. Essas experiências foram inspiradoras para que a sociedade civil enviasse à Assembleia Constituinte, instituída ao final da ditadura militar e responsável pela formulação de uma nova Constituição (1986-1988), um manifesto que propunha a criação de mecanismos de participação nos municípios do país. O resultado dessa mobilização foi a inscrição do direito à participação direta na Constituição Federal brasileira de 1988 e a previsão constitucional da participação da sociedade na definição e no controle de várias áreas de políticas públicas, como a previdência social, a saúde, a assistência social e a educação. Outras áreas regulamentaram a participação em leis específicas formuladas posteriormente. Em comum a essas áreas está a concretização da participação por meio de conselhos (Michiles, 1989; Teixeira, 2000 apud CUNHA, 2013).A partir dessa regulamentação das áreas de políticas públicas, observou-se uma intensa criação de conselhos no nível municipal, especialmente na década de 1990 (Faria e Coelho, 2010) e a ampliação no nível federal na primeira década do Séc. XXI. Em 2013, contabilizavam-se mais de 40.000 conselhos municipais, sendo que 90% dos municípios brasileiros possuía ao menos 5 conselhos implantados, enquanto no nível federal existiam 36 (Buvinich, 2014).Esses conselhos de políticas públicas diferem significativamente dos seus predecessores em razão: da autonomia da representação (os mandados da sociedade civil não são subordinados ao poder público); da democratização da composição (incluem representantes de diferentes organizações da sociedade civil); da articulação entre participação e representação (os membros da sociedade civil possuem vínculos com associações civis diferenciadas); e da incorporação de práticas características de organizações da sociedade civil (Cunha, 2013). <h3>Participant Selection</h3>Os conselhos são compostos por um número variado de membros (prevalece de 10 a 20 membros) (Faria e Coelho, 2010), que representam segmentos da sociedade e do governo em proporção variada (alguns são paritários entre sociedade e governo, outros pendem mais para a representação da sociedade e outros para a representação governamental) e que possuem envolvimento prévio com a área de política pública, como profissional, usuário, prestador de serviços (públicos e privados), dentre outros. A composição híbrida dos conselhos aponta para processos diferenciados de seleção de participantes – nesse caso, representantes. Os representantes governamentais são indicados pelo próprio governo e correspondem a membros de órgãos públicos responsáveis pela política e outros relacionados à sua gestão. Os representantes da sociedade civil são definidos por diferentes meios, a depender da lei que instituiu o conselho: escolhidos por meio de processos públicos abertos a todos os interessados, indicados por organizações da sociedade civil previamente definidas na lei, indicados pelo governo. No primeiro caso são realizadas eleições, das quais participam organizações da sociedade civil relacionadas com a área da política pública, que são eleitoras previamente cadastradas ao processo eleitoral, bem como possíveis candidatas.  <h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3>Há grande variação quanto aos processos de deliberação, de decisão e de interação com o público nos conselhos. De modo geral, os conselhos se reúnem com alguma regularidade (uma vez ao mês é o que prevalece) para deliberarem e decidirem sobre uma pauta previamente definida. Essa pauta pode ser construída pelo conselho ou por seus dirigentes (presidente e/ou mesa diretora), atendendo a demandas do governo, de organizações da sociedade ou mesmo de cidadãos. Alguns conselhos alteram a pauta durante a reunião, por solicitação de algum membro ou mesmo dos participantes não conselheiros.As reuniões dos conselhos são públicas, abertas à presença de qualquer interessado, sendo que alguns conselhos admitem a vocalização de qualquer participante e outros restringem esse tipo de intervenção, condicionando-a a uma autorização prévia pelos conselheiros. No entanto, só os conselheiros podem tomar decisões. As decisões, de modo geral, são feitas por votação, nas quais se exige maioria simples de votos, sendo que apenas se exige quórum especial (2/3 dos membros) para os casos de alteração do regimento interno (Avritzer, 2010; Pires 2011). As decisões dos conselhos devem ser formalizadas em resoluções às quais se deve dar ampla divulgação, especialmente as que são vinculantes.Há conselhos que possuem uma divisão interna (comissões e/ou grupos de trabalho), que são integradas por parte dos conselheiros, que analisam os temas em pauta previamente às reuniões. Esses subgrupos podem contar com a contribuição de especialistas e de pessoas interessadas para a análise da questão em pauta e para a construção de uma posição mais fundamentada para o debate. Os resultados dessa análise são levados à assembleia e cabe à ela o debate final e a tomada de decisão sobre a questão. A interação dos conselhos com o público pode ocorrer durante as reuniões dos conselhos ou nos interstícios dessas reuniões, por meio de contatos individuais dos conselheiros, de eventos promovidos pela área da política pública, por diferentes mídias (websites, jornais, folders, dentre outros) e, em alguns casos, por meio de conferências de políticas públicas, uma outra instituição participativa que ocorre periódica e regularmente (a cada 2 ou 4 anos, conforme a área) e que reúne milhares de participantes em cada nível de governo em que ocorre – municípios, estados e União.  <h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3>Estudos sobre conselhos de políticas apontam diferentes perspectivas para sua análise, bem como diferentes resultados. As principais conclusões apontam que, de modo geral, os conselhos são espaços abertos ao acolhimento e ao processamento de demandas da sociedade civil e que o desenho institucional é relevante, pois tanto pode compensar desigualdades socioeconômicas e informacionais entre conselheiros e favorecer a democratização dos próprios conselhos, quanto limitar a participação para aqueles que não estão organizados ou associados. Além disso, há diferenças significativas quanto à capacidade de vocalização e de deliberação e os tipos de decisão, que variam conforme a natureza da política e o segmento de origem dos conselheiros. Outro fator que incide na efetividade dos conselhos é a existência de associações e organizações proativas no cenário político, bem como o apoio e a presença efetiva do governante nos processos deliberativos. Quanto à interação com o público, verifica-se que os contatos do conselho com ele informam, mas não determinam as decisões dos conselheiros. Essas conclusões apontam que há limites à efetivação dos conselhos que estão localizados tanto no seu interior quanto no ambiente político-institucional no qual estão inseridos. <h3>Secondary Sources</h3>AVRITZER, Leonardo.

As laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, the ECI is unique in that it is one of the first transnational participatory instruments. In most European countries, citizens’ initiatives already exist at national, regional, and local levels, although they vary significantly in terms of their procedure and scope. The ECI allows citizens to address issues that cut across Member States.</p><p>The ECI is not the first participatory instrument in the EU. Before the creation of the ECI, the right to petition to the European Parliament was established under previous treaties. Petitions and initiatives differ in several ways. First,  petitions have no formal minimum number of signatures, nor do they require a broad base of support across multiple Member States. Second, petitions may be submitted by companies, organizations, and non-citizen residents. </p><p>The European Commission believes that the ECI is “widening up the sphere of public debate, allowing citizens to participate more intensively in the democratic life of the Union, through this new ‘participatory democracy’ tool.” </p><h3>History</h3><p>The legal basis of the ECI is laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in December 2009 and amends the Maastricht Treaty (1992) and Treaty of Rome (1957). The Treaty of Lisbon reinforces the right of citizens to “participate in the democratic life of the Union” and outlines the details of the ECI.</p><p>The first initiatives were registered in early 2012.</p><p>In its formative stages, the right to initiative was advocated by the ECI Campaign, a grassroots coalition of democracy proponents and over 120 European NGOs. The group successfully lobbied for the inclusion of the ECI in the draft EU Constitution and Lisbon Treaty. Currently, the campaign monitors the implementation of the ECI, provides guidance to individuals and groups organizing initiatives, and examines how the framework can be ameliorated.</p><h3>Organizing Entities</h3><p>The ECI program is primarily overseen by the European Commission, the executive governing body of the EU. When an ECI is registered, it is the Commission that reviews the proposal and decides whether or not take the matter forward. In other words, a successful initiative with over 1 million signatures is not binding. No EU funding is provided to organizers of an ECI.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The nature of the ECI means that participation is open to all EU citizens (i.e., nationals of a Member State); non-EU nationals cannot organize a citizens’ initiative, serve as members of a citizens’ committee, or submit a statement of support. To participate in any part of the process, citizens need to be old enough (though not necessarily registered) to vote in European Parliament elections – 18 years of age, except in Austria where the minimum age is 16.</p><p>Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) may be members of citizens’ committees but cannot be counted as one of the requisite 7 citizens, meaning that they may not be mentioned on the committee registration form.  Participants in the citizens' committees must residie in at least 7 different Member States.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The first stage in the ECI process is the establishment of a citizens’ committee which must include residents from at least 7 Member States. This body, which cannot be run by formal organizations, must be composed of EU citizens old enough to vote. It is this committee that officially provides the wording of the proposed initiative to the Commission. The Commission then has two months to either register or reject the proposal. Rejection can be for a number of reasons, including the composition of the committee. The proposal can also be rejected where it falls outside the powers of the Commission, “is manifestly abusive, frivolous or vexatious”, or is “manifestly contrary to the values of the Union.” In its original formulation of the ECI, the Commission had suggested that registration should take place after a significant number of signatures have been collected to indicate that there is support for the proposal, but it was recognized that the rejection of an initiative at that point could cause considerable public disquiet.</p><p>If a proposal is registered and made public, the organizers have 12 months to collect 1 million signatures, formally called statements of support. Nationals of any Member State can sign a citizens’ initiative provided they are old enough to vote in the European Parliament elections. Statements of support may be collected in paper or online, but they must be registered on specific forms which comply with regulations. There was originally some disagreement between the Commission, Council and Parliament and those contributing to consultation on the ECI as to the minimum number of Member States from which signatures must be drawn. The final regulation states that signatures must come from at least one quarter of EU countries, or 7 out of 27. However, to ensure that the 1 million is reasonably representative – and not just from one or two Member States – the initiative must collect a minimum number of signatories from each of the 7 Member States. This threshold is directly proportional to the population of each Member State, following the proportions used for the number of MEPs (and multiplied by 750). Thus the minimum number of signatories from Malta is 4,500 compared to 74,250 from Germany.</p><p>Assuming the organizing committee has been able to collect the requisite number of signatures and fulfilled the relevant national thresholds, national authorities then have three months to verify the signatures from their polity. Assuming that the verification is successful, the organizing committee is then in a position to formally present the initiative to the Commission. The Commission has three months to respond, during which officials are expected to meet with the organizers to ensure the details of the proposal are understood and arrange a public hearing at the European Parliament. Having examined the proposal, the Commission is required to communicate an explanation of its response to the initiative, detailing the reasons behind its actions and other decisions. However, it is important to note that the Commission is not obliged to propose legislation as a result of an initiative, even if it collects enough signatures. The Commission's decision is not subject to an appeal procedure.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The first ECI was symbolically registered by the Commission on Europe Day – May 9, 2012. This initiative, named <em>Fraternité 2020</em>, is a movement by the Young European Citizens’ Convention to enhance European exchange programs (such as Erasmus and the European Voluntary Service) and increase international solidarity. As of July 2012, six other ECIs had been officially registered, including:</p><ul><li><em>Stop Vivisection </em>(advocating animal rights and the protection of their welfare in scientific research)</li></ul><ul><li><em>Let Me Vote</em> (petitioning for the right of EU citizens living in another Member State to vote in all political elections in their country of residence)</li></ul><ul><li><em>One of Us</em> (arguing for the right to life from conception and denouncing the use of human embryos in research)</li></ul><ul><li><em>EU Directive on Dairy Cow Welfare</em> (supporting policies to improve the well-being of cows)</li></ul><ul><li><em>Right to Water</em> (advocating that access to sufficient and clean drinking water is a human right, and that management of water resources should not be liberalized)</li></ul><ul><li><em>Single Communication Tariff Act</em> (lobbying for the end of roaming fees across Europe)</li></ul><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>In the official press release welcoming the speed of agreement between the European Parliament and Council on the realization of this new democratic innovation, Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President for Inter-institutional Relations and Administration, stated: “The ECI will introduce a whole new form of participatory democracy to the EU. It is a major step forward in the democratic life of the Union. It's a concrete example of bringing Europe closer to its citizens. And it will foster a cross border debate about what we are doing in Brussels and thus contribute, we hope, to the development of a real European public space.”</p><p>The ECI is explicitly transnational in its ambition, requiring significant support – 1 million signatures – from citizens from across a number of Member States. It is this feature that distinguishes the ECI from the existing European Parliament Petition (EPP), which can be proposed by a single signatory. In addition, the ECI has been described as extremely innovative; it serves as the most direct route for citizens to influence the agenda-setting process at the highest levels of the EU. </p><p>The ECI has attracted some legitimate criticism. For one, some critics have decried the amount of personal data that citizens must provide on their statements of support. Signatories need to submit their full name, address, date and place of birth, nationality, and personal identification number (either a passport or identity card number). Regulations exist to ensure that these data are protected and properly used, but there are still respectable concerns about the process, especially with regards to the online collection system.</p><p>Just as importantly, many experts and advocates believe that the ECI should be made more citizen-friendly and workable. As opposed to national or regional movements, ECIs are necessarily transnational in scope, so campaigning becomes far more complex. Large geographic distances make it costly and challenging for citizens to meet and plan, let alone gather signatures. Language barriers also complicate the process, especially given that more than 20 official languages are spoken across the EU. Finally, as the ECI Campaign notes, “the absence of a strong common public space makes it almost impossible to make one’s voice heard Europe-wide through the media.”</p><p>The ECI Campaign has expressed satisfaction with the present success of the program, but it views the ECI as only the first step towards direct democracy and not as an end in itself. The group has identified some burdensome restrictions which it seeks to remove in 2015, when the ECI is officially reviewed. These proposed changes include:</p><ul><li>Simplifying the signature form. Concerns have arisen over privacy concerns and specifically the requirement for signatories to provide personal identification numbers.</li></ul><ul><li>Extending the time limit for signature collection from 12 to 18-24 months. The ECI Campaign believes one year is too short for smaller organizations without large budgets to raise awareness about issues that are not well understood by the general public.</li></ul><ul><li>Permitting ECIs to propose amendments to EU treaties. Currently, the Commission will not register initiatives which aim to achieve this, although the law on this issue may be open to challenge by the European Court of Justice.</li></ul><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Citizens' Guide to the ECI: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/files/guide-eci-en.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/files/guide-eci-en.pdf</a></p><p>ECI Official Register: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome\">http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome</a></p><p>ECI FAQs: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/faq\">http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/faq</a></p><p>Description of EU Petitions: <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00533cec74/Petitions.html\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00533cec74/Petitions.html</a></p><p>ECI Campaign: <a href=\"http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/\">http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/</a></p><p>European Commission and the ECI: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/index_en...</a></p><p>Treaty of Lisbon's ECI Regulations: <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:065:0001:0022:EN:PDF\">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:065:0001...</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>This article first appeared as a case study by Graham Smith.

Os Conselhos de Direitos da Criança e do Adolescente foram previstos pelo Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (Lei federal 8.069 de 1990) e receberam a atribuição de formular e monitorar a implementação das políticas públicas destinadas aos adolescentes e às crianças brasileiras. Sendo um órgão deliberativo, o conselho tem a atribuição de elaborar um planejamento anual para a política pública destinada àquele público, nos municípios, nos estados e no governo federal. Os conselhos estão hoje presentes em praticamente todos os municípios brasileiros, pois a legislação atual exige a existência do conselho para que o governo federal possa fazer a transferência de recursos para a implementação das políticas públicas desta área. Deriva desta estratégia o sucesso na criação dos conselhos no país, uma vez que os municípios pretendem receber os recursos dos diversos programas relacionados à área da criança e do adolescente.  <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3> É possível indicar algumas potencialidades dos Conselhos: 1) efeito pedagógico de estímulo à participação dos cidadãos e à democratização da gestão pública; 2) aperfeiçoamento do diálogo entre o Estado e a sociedade; 3) planejamento aprimorado da oferta de serviços públicos; 4) monitoramento das ações e serviços das políticas públicas.  Mas, também, podem-se indicar alguns entraves para seu sucesso: 1) desigualdades entre os participantes, em relação à informação, à qualificação e à assimetria de poder; 2) falta de cultura participativa dos municípios; 3) ausência de compromisso dos gestores públicos com tais espaços; 4) ausência de qualificação da burocracia e reduzida capacidade administrativa.  <h3>History</h3> A Constituição de 1988 foi a grande responsável pela ampla disseminação dos conselhos no sistema político brasileiro. A política destinada às crianças e adolescentes foi considerada prioritária e deveria ser realizada conjuntamente pelo Estado e pela sociedade. Posteriormente, foi publicada a Lei Federal Nº 8.069 de 13 de julho de 1990, que tornou obrigatória a criação dos Conselhos de Direitos da Criança e do Adolescente no governo federal, nos Estados e nos municípios. A mesma lei criou, ainda, os Conselhos Tutelares, que são compostos por indivíduos eleitos pela comunidade para atuar em defesa dos direitos das crianças e adolescentes previstos no Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (Lei Federal Nº 8.069 de 13 de julho de 1990).  A maior parte dos conselhos da criança e do adolescente existentes no Brasil foi criada após o ano de 1996. Apesar da legislação que o criou ter sido publicada em 1990, alguns anos se passaram até que a maioria dos municípios tomasse a iniciativa de criar os conselhos. Nos municípios maiores, nos quais é possível encontrar um movimento organizado da sociedade civil em defesa dos direitos da criança e do adolescente, os conselhos tendem a funcionar melhor e a produzir resultados mais expressivos em termos de políticas públicas para as crianças e adolescentes. No entanto, aproximadamente 70% dos municípios brasileiros são pequenas cidades, com até 20 mil habitantes. Nestes locais, a dinâmica de funcionamento dos conselhos pode ser bastante comprometida, pois os prefeitos tendem a indicar para a composição do conselho apenas indivíduos que são fortemente influenciados por ele. Neste caso, se a sociedade civil for pouco participativa e não apresentar a organização e a força suficiente para se contrapor ao poder público, reduz a possibilidade de atuação como agente propositivo de políticas e ações.  <h3>Participant Selection</h3>A seleção dos participantes do conselho (conselheiros) pode ser bem variada de um município para o outro. Mas, em geral, os representantes do poder público são indicados pelo Prefeito e são provenientes de diversas áreas temáticas de políticas públicas, isto é, são representantes da política de assistência social, de saúde, de educação, de esportes e lazer, de cultura etc. Os representantes da sociedade civil podem ser escolhidos em fóruns próprios, organizados e conduzidos pelo próprio conselho, com o propósito de se realizar eleições ou outros processos de escolha das Organizações da Sociedade Civil que irão representar a sociedade nos conselhos. É importante notar que os representantes são sempre membros de Organizações da Sociedade Civil, isto é, trata-se da representação de coletividades e não de indivíduos. Pode haver, ainda, eleições durante as conferências de políticas públicas, que são organizadas a cada dois ou três anos para que a sociedade possa deliberar sobre as diretrizes de políticas públicas para as crianças e adolescentes nos próximos anos. Todos os presentes votam, então, naquelas organizações que irão representar a sociedade civil nos conselhos.  Uma questão extremamente relevante no estudo do funcionamento dos conselhos se refere à ação dos representantes, ou melhor, à representatividade dos conselheiros que tomam assento na instituição, para representar quer o Estado, quer a sociedade.  Na relação do conselheiro com sua entidade, pode-se afirmar que, quanto maior o vínculo que os liga, maior a probabilidade de que diferentes interesses possam fazer-se representados. Os estudos indicam que a representatividade dos conselheiros governamentais apresenta problemas, devido ao frágil vínculo entre os representantes governamentais e seus órgãos de origem. Muitos casos pesquisados indicam que o funcionário enviado pelas agências governamentais nem sempre tem o poder de assumir compromissos em nome dos órgãos que representam. Da mesma forma, quando leva as decisões ao seu local de trabalho, seus superiores podem não acatar as decisões que foram tomadas.  No campo da representação não-governamental, também é possível constatar a fragilidade do vínculo entre os conselheiros e as entidades a que pertencem. Nesse caso, os problemas geralmente mencionados relacionam-se ao preparo dos representantes indicados, pois o exercício da atividade de conselheiro exige certo preparo do representante da instituição, mas não é conveniente que apenas alguns membros da entidade se especializem nesta função, uma vez que este processo tende a distanciá-los das atividades mais gerais da entidade. Por outro lado, não se pode enviar qualquer representante ao conselho, sob pena de que ele não tenha clareza do papel que tem a cumprir. <h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3>O grande desafio presente nos conselhos, enquanto instituições participativas, é construir mecanismos capazes de reduzir os efeitos das desigualdades sociais no interior dos processos decisórios, de forma a permitir que a construção dos acordos não esteja sujeita à influência de fatores como o poder, a riqueza ou as desigualdades sociais preexistentes.  Os conselhos, geralmente, se reúnem uma vez por mês com o propósito de se produzir as decisões relacionadas às políticas destinadas às crianças e adolescentes do município. As reuniões são públicas e abertas à participação da comunidade, que possuem o direito a fazer uso da voz, mas não podem votar. O voto é restrito aos conselheiros, que possuem igualdade no processo decisório e exercem uma função pública não remunerada. As decisões são produzidas pelo coletivo dos conselheiros que interagem publicamente nas reuniões. Estas são orientadas por uma pauta, construída previamente pelos próprios conselheiros, geralmente, na reunião precedente. Em alguns conselhos apenas os membros da mesa diretora podem incluir temas na pauta, mas, geralmente, todos os conselheiros podem sugerir temas e questões para serem incluídas na pauta que será discutida pelos conselheiros. Nos conselhos mais institucionalizados, a pauta de cada reunião é enviada com antecedência para os conselheiros, que podem se preparar previamente para a reunião. Alguns conselheiros realizam uma consulta prévia aos dirigentes de suas organizações de origem e, até mesmo, ao público que eles representam nos conselhos.  <h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3>As características dos conselhos podem variar bastante de um município para outro. A literatura tem indicado pelo menos quatro elementos explicam o sucesso ou o fracasso das Instituições Participativas. O primeiro deles é o desenho institucional, que nos permite verificar o grau de inclusividade da instituição, a heterogeneidade da sua composição, a abertura para a participação de atores externos ao conselho, dentre outros. Estes elementos podem favorecer a inclusão e o empoderamento dos participantes presentes naquela instituição, isto é, os conselheiros. O segundo é a tradição associativa local, isto é, a densidade das associações da sociedade civil presentes no município e sua capacidade de promover mobilizações e propor ações para a melhoria das ações voltadas para as crianças e adolescentes. O terceiro aspecto diz respeito às capacidades administrativas e financeiras da gestão municipal para a implementação de políticas destinadas às crianças e aos adolescentes, pois tal característica é fundamental para qualidade das políticas que serão formuladas e implementas no município. O quarto elemento está relacionado ao comprometimento e o respeitos dos gestores municipais em relação às decisões produzidas pelos conselhos. Isto é, importa saber se os gestores públicos conferem poder aos conselhos enquanto arenas deliberativas da política relacionada às crianças e aos adolescentes do município, pois este empoderamento é fundamental para o sucesso do conselho enquanto uma arena realmente deliberativa no município. Os resultados das deliberações produzidas pelos conselhos podem ser bem diversos, mas são mais efetivos quando a combinação daquelas quatro variáveis acima é positiva e o conselho se afirma enquanto uma instituição capaz de influenciar os resultados da política pública.  <h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3>Os conselhos da criança e do adolescente tem o mérito de ampliar a participação dos atores com poder de decisão sobre as políticas públicas destinadas às crianças e adolescentes no Brasil. No entanto, há um conjunto de características que tem dificultado a influência destas instituições sobre os resultados de políticas públicas. A principal delas, possivelmente, é persistência de elevados padrões de desigualdades entre os participantes daquela arena. A análise do perfil dos conselheiros indica que os conselheiros possuem renda e educação bem superior à média da população, o que nos mostra que aqueles indivíduos que possuem níveis inferiores de educação e de renda têm dificuldade de serem incluídos nestas arenas. Tal situação pode reproduzir as desigualdades já existentes.  Outra questão importante é a falta de compromisso de muitos gestores públicos com as decisões provenientes dessas arenas. Em municípios de pequeno porte, principalmente, é bem provável que os prefeitos tenham grande influência sobre a escolha dos conselheiros, o que pode reduzir o empoderamento destas arenas. O bom funcionamento dos conselhos depende muito da infraestrutura a ele fornecida pelo poder público, que está relacionada aos equipamentos e também aos servidores que são responsáveis pela instituição. Há conselhos que não possuem local apropriado para se reunir e nem dispõem de funcionários públicos necessários para o bom funcionamento do órgão. Estes elementos influenciam na capacidade dos conselhos de produzir bons resultados sobre as políticas públicas. A questão estrutural mais relevante no caso dos conselhos da criança e do adolescente é ausência de representantes deste público no conselho, isto é, enquanto em outras áreas de políticas (saúde e assistência social) existem representantes dos usuários das políticas nos conselhos, isto não acontece nos conselhos da criança. Não há crianças e adolescentes atuando como conselheiros, o que significa que são sempre os adultos que os representam. Este deficiência pode comprometer a legitimidade das decisões produzidas pelos conselhos.  ","title":"Os conselhos da criança e do adolescente no Brasil","language":"en","method_id":4403,"authors":[{"user_id":153320,"timestamp":"2016-05-26T12:26:17-07:00","name":"Melodie Jean-baptiste"}]},{"id":4395,"type":"method","original_language":"pt","best_for":null,"communication_mode":null,"decision_method":null,"facilitated":false,"governance_contribution":null,"issue_interdependency":null,"issue_polarization":null,"issue_technical_complexity":null,"kind_of_influence":null,"method_of_interaction":null,"public_interaction_method":null,"post_date":"2016-05-25T18:33:40.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":null,"typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":null,"updated_date":"2016-05-25T18:33:40.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<p>1st. version 05/16 by <em>Marjorie Corrêa Marona (UFMG); Marta Mendes Rocha (UFJF)</em>.</p><h3>Definition<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/br92J5A.png?3\" /></h3>Genericamente, as Audiências Públicas (APs) se constituem como um instrumento de participação popular[1], previsto pela Constituição Brasileira de 1988[2], que em seu art. 58 dispõe que às comissões da Câmara dos Deputados e do Senado Federal cabem, em razão da matéria de sua competência, realizar audiências públicas com entidades da sociedade civil. Existe, ademais, regulação na legislação infraconstitucional. Tanto a Câmara dos Deputados quanto o Senado Federal dispõem, em seus respectivos Regimentos Internos, sobre as regras e procedimentos para realização de audiências públicas (RICD, art. 255 a 258; RISF, arts. 93 a 95). Em ambos os casos o expediente é considerado uma forma das comissões parlamentares instruírem matéria legislativa em trâmite, bem como tratarem de assuntos de interesse público relevante.Não há consenso em relação a uma definição de audiência pública na literatura acadêmica especializada, mas da forma como vêm sendo praticadas nas casas legislativas brasileiras as APs consistem em reuniões abertas promovidas pelas comissões parlamentares, das quais podem participar legisladores, cidadãos, representantes de entidades da sociedade civil, técnicos e especialistas com o objetivo de promover o debate em torno de tema ou questão de interesse público na área da respectiva comissão.No Poder Judiciário, particularmente, a previsão de audiências públicas no campo de ação do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) remete à publicação da Lei nº 9.868, de 1999, devendo ser referida também a Lei 9882/99 – a primeira regulamenta a Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade (ADI) e a Ação Declaratória de Constitucionalidade (ADC) e a segunda trata da Arguição de Descumprimento de Preceito Fundamental (ADPF). Com isso, estabeleceu-se a previsão de realização de APs no âmbito do exercício do controle concentrado de constitucionalidade, por convocação do Presidente da Corte ou do Relator do processo e com a participação de membros da sociedade civil, para fins de esclarecimento de matéria ou circunstância de fato. O Regimento Interno do Supremo Tribunal Federal (RISTF)[3], em seu art. 13, incisos XVII e XVIII, prevê a possibilidade de convocação de audiência pública, pelo Presidente da Corte, para “ouvir o depoimento de pessoas com experiência e autoridade em determinada matéria, sempre que entender necessário o esclarecimento de questões ou circunstâncias de fato, com repercussão geral e de interesse público relevante, debatidas no âmbito do tribunal”. Dispõe, ademais, no parágrafo único, incisos II e III do art. 154, sobre a competência do Ministro-Relator para convocar a AP, estabelecendo que deverá ser garantida a participação das diversas correntes de opinião e que a ele toca a decisão sobre a seleção das pessoas que serão ouvidas, divulgação da lista dos habilitados, determinação da ordem dos trabalhos e fixação do tempo de que cada um disporá para se manifestar. Por fim, também por determinação regimental (art. 154, parágrafo único, IV a VII), prevê-se que as audiências públicas serão transmitida pela TV Justiça e pela Rádio Justiça, que os trabalhos da audiência pública serão registrados e juntados aos autos do processo, quando for o caso, ou arquivados no âmbito da Presidência, e que os casos omissos serão resolvidos pelo Ministro que convocar a audiência.Há, portanto, procedimentos formais, regras que envolvem a formalização da AP (data e hora definidas, pauta clara, atas das sessões, gravação em vídeo e/ou voz), e a condução do debate (determinação de quais atores possuem a palavra, seu tempo de fala, dinâmica da interação). Em geral, as APs começam com uma fala de abertura do relator, que cede a palavra para o representante do Ministério Público apresentar suas considerações. A partir daí, os expositores se manifestam um a um de acordo com a ordem previamente estabelecida. <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3>Contemporaneamente, as Cortes Constitucionais são ora tomadas como lócus da razão pública (Dworkin, 2010), ora são destacadas como um interlocutor institucional (Mendes, 2009; Bateup, 2006), ora são caracterizadas por sua própria capacidade de deliberar (Ferejohn & Pasquino, 2002, 2004). Particularmente, o relevo que o liberalismo contemporâneo empresta à capacidade argumentativa das Cortes (Dworkin, 2010) e a correlata ideia de que o direito retira sua legitimidade de uma cultura de justificação (Sachs, 2009; Woolman & Bishop, 2008), a qual é parte fundante de democracias genuínas (Mendes, 2014), reposiciona a atuação das Cortes no interior de uma cadeia decisória deliberativa (Ferenjohn & Pasquino, 2004; Bateup, 2006; Mendes, 2009). Por outro lado, pressupõe-se que as Cortes Constitucionais sejam afetadas pelo ambiente político que as circunda (Friedman, 2009) e busquem ser responsivas em face do que circula na esfera pública ampliada. A questão da legitimidade democrática das Cortes ganha, portanto, novos contornos, vinculada à sua capacidade de inserir-se em uma dinâmica deliberativa interinstitucional e, também, socioestatal, além de apresentar capacidade deliberativa interna, beneficiando-se de sua peculiar condição decisória (Edwards, 2003). Nesse quadrante, as audiências públicas – que florescem na jurisdição constitucional brasileira – representam uma inovação institucional com potencial para realinhar o debate acerca da legitimidade democrática das Cortes Constitucionais, pela ampliação da inclusão que promovem, sob o ponto de vista da integração de atores, mas também de argumentos epistêmicos (Landemore, 2015) que têm aparecido especialmente nos debates de fundo moral. Isso depende, contudo, da sua capacidade de promover deliberação interna à Corte, fomentar o diálogo interinstitucional (Tulis, 2003; Mendonça & Amaral, 2014; Steiner et al, 2004) e, ainda, funcionar como uma espécie de interface socioestatal (Isunza & Hevia, 2006).  Do modo como vêm sendo praticadas pelo STF, ainda que possuam regras específicas para o seu funcionamento, as APs variam tanto em relação ao seu formato, considerando a ampla liberdade que o relator tem para definir não somente quem participará, mas também as regras de interação entre os expositores, quanto em face de seus possíveis seus usos e efeitos. <h3>History</h3>Desde 2007, o STF realizou audiências públicas sobre os mais diversos temas, tanto em sede de ADIs e ADPFs, quanto em sede de RExt. Precisamente, entre 2007 e 2014, o STF realizou 15 (quinze) audiências públicas. Com exceção de uma – que versou sobre a importação de pneus usados – todas as demais se encontram parcial ou totalmente documentadas no portal do tribunal. [4]No que diz respeito à incidência geral das audiências públicas na jurisdição constitucional pode-se dizer que o uso desse mecanismo institucional vem se intensificando ao longo dos anos, não apenas no âmbito das ações constitucionais – casos em que o STF atua como Corte Constitucional, propriamente – mas, também, quando atua como instância recursal do poder judiciário, embora globalmente ainda seja um recurso de exceção. Ao longo dos anos a utilização das APs tornou-se mais frequente: se nos cinco primeiros anos (de 2007 a 2011) realizaram-se 05 (cinco) APs, nos últimos dois anos, já foram realizadas 09 (nove), com destaque para o ano de 2013, quando foram realizadas 07 (sete) APs. [5]<br />As APs no STF, contudo, possuem um caráter pontual quando se considera o total de processos que chegam ao STF, e destes, o total que envolve o controle de constitucionalidade – seja em sede de Recurso Extraordinário, seja pelo julgamento de ações diretas. Nota-se que o recurso à AP é uma exceção, provavelmente mobilizado para a resolução de casos considerados mais complexos e controversos pela Corte. As questões que envolvem a realização das APs são não apenas complexas, do ponto de vista jurídico, mas impactam profundamente a agenda pública nacional. Basta que se mencione que pelos menos duas APs – pesquisas com célula tronco embrionárias e aborto em caso de anencefalia - envolveram o debate em torno do “direito à vida” que extrapola as fronteiras da dogmática constitucional e se encontra com os discursos (e lutas) mais contemporâneos do feminismo. Vale mencionar que ainda de forma mais direta, o STF realizou audiência pública em meio à disputa em torno do “Mais Médicos” – um dos principais programas do governo federal na área de saúde, durante o primeiro mandato da Presidente Dilma Rousseff. Ainda na área da saúde, outras duas APs foram convocadas, para que diretamente fossem debatidos aspectos da política pública nesse campo, particularmente relacionados com o Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS. A ação afirmativa racial, que previa reserva de vagas no ensino público superior também não escapou das considerações do STF e, mais uma vez nesse caso, uma AP foi convocada. Ademais, questões ambientais foram objeto de escrutínio no âmbito de ações constitucionais que mereceram a realização de APs: importação de pneus usados, campo eletromagnético, queimadas, proibição do uso de amianto. Por fim, realizou-se AP no âmbito da ação constitucional que tratava do sistema de financiamento de campanhas no Brasil, aspecto central de disputa política no contexto democrático atual.<h3>Participant Selection</h3>Cada vez que uma AP é convocada a Corte divulga em seu sítio eletrônico uma síntese das regras de participação. Existem três modalidades de participação: (1) como parte da plateia sem direito a qualquer manifestação; (2) enviando sugestões; e (3) como expositor na audiência, caso em que é necessária inscrição prévia e deferimento pelo relator. No primeiro caso, o limite para participação é a capacidade do local de realização[6] e os lugares são ocupados por ordem de chegada, respeitada a reserva aos expositores e à imprensa. No segundo caso, admite-se que qualquer pessoa ou entidade, independentemente de inscrição, encaminhe documentos úteis ao esclarecimento das questões a serem debatidas na AP, pela via impressa ou eletrônica.[7] O terceiro e mais importante caso versa sobre os expositores da AP, os quais são indicados pelas partes do processo, por órgãos e entes estatais e entidades da sociedade civil ou pelos interessados que requerem sua participação (especialistas habilitados)[8].  Destacam-se aqui outras características das APs, considerando, particularmente as regras de participação dos expositores. As APs possuem um caráter presencial, ou seja, não podem ser realizadas pela internet e permitem um intercâmbio documental bastante restrito, privilegiando a manifestação oral dos participantes, com o intuito de promover um debate em torno da questão controversa. Ademais, embora seja possível a participação de atores individuais – especialmente como expectadores – privilegia-se a participação de caráter coletivo. Mais de 400 expositores já participaram de APs no STF. Os expositores podem ser classificados de acordo com a origem da sua indicação: (1) agentes estatais, indicados por um dos três poderes da República, ou o representante do Ministério Público, ou (2) sociedade civil, representantes de associações profissionais, entidades de classe, sociedades médicas, movimentos sociais, frentes, conselhos de políticas públicas, associações de tipos e formas de organização variadas voltadas para a ajuda mútua e defesa de causas, ou, ainda, (3) especialistas, que não se apresentam como “falando em nome de” ou expondo uma posição oficial das instituições e entidades das quais faziam parte, amparando-se a participação na expertise acumulada pelo expositor, seja como estudioso ou pesquisador do tema debatido, seja como ocupante de cargos em instituições importantes na área.O número de expositores por AP varia bastante, mas registra-se uma maior participação, em termos quantitativos, de expositores indicados por associações ou coletivos da sociedade civil: as organizações sociais representam 37% do total de participantes, seguida dos especialistas que correspondem a 30%. Dentre os agentes estatais, os indicados pelo Poder Executivo foram os mais presentes, estando ausentes apenas da primeira AP, realizada no ano de 2007. Representantes do Poder Legislativo estiveram presentes em 10 APs, sendo oriundos, majoritariamente, da Câmara dos Deputados, particularmente nas situações em que haviam sido autores das leis debatidas ou relatores de projetos de lei relacionados ao tema em discussão. Em relação à esfera de atuação, há predomínio de representantes de instituições situadas no nível nacional: 67% atuam no nível nacional, 29,3% representantes de órgãos e instituições de abrangência estadual e de apenas 3,7% da esfera municipal, considerando tanto os agentes estatais quanto os representantes da sociedade civil. Esse predomínio pode ser explicado pela natureza – constitucional – das questões em debate, relacionando-se com a própria divisão constitucional de competências que coloca nas mãos do poder central a maior parte das responsabilidades e atribuições em uma ampla gama de temas e assuntos. Por outro lado, o perfil dos participantes varia conforme a temática tratada, se relaciona com a distribuição de competências entre os entes federados e com a origem da ação que desencadeou o processo, e está associado às escolhas feitas pelas partes, responsáveis pela indicação dos expositores, e pelos ministros, responsáveis pelo deferimento e indeferimento das solicitações o que impacta, diretamente, na concepção de sociedade civil adotada em cada caso.<h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3>A grande liberdade atribuída regimentalmente ao ministro-relator para que decida, discricionariamente, acerca das pessoas que serão ouvidas, a ordem dos trabalhos e o tempo reservado para cada expositor, associada ao fato de que por reiteradas vezes os relatores exerceram algum tipo de controle sobre o conteúdo das exposições, limita a capacidade dos expositores para incluir tópicos na agenda e tampouco dar-lhes o tratamento desejado, o que pode restringir o potencial caráter deliberativo das APs.Registram-se, ainda, limitações quanto à possibilidade de interação entre os participantes, inviabilizando o intercâmbio regulado de razões com vistas à apresentação e à justificação de posições e à persuasão mútua. É possível reconhecer pelo menos quatro cenários diferentes de interação nas APs: (1) apresentação dos expositores, sem intervenções durante ou ao final da audiência; (2) apresentação dos expositores, sem intervenções durante ou ao final da audiência, mas com perguntas dos ministros ao final; (3) apresentação dos expositores, com intervenções pontuais para pergunta/esclarecimento do representante do MP ou do relator; (4) apresentação dos expositores, com possibilidade de intervenção do representante do MP, advogado da arguente e relator ao final de cada exposição para perguntas e esclarecimentos.De modo geral, o formato das audiências faz com que elas se assemelhem mais a uma arguição do que a um debate propriamente dito. Em nenhum caso foi permitido aos participantes dirigirem a palavra uns aos outros sob o argumento de que se tratava de uma audiência de caráter instrutório e mesmo as menções de um expositor à fala ou argumentação de outro eram reguladas. Ainda assim, verifica-se certo intercâmbio indireto de ideias e troca de informações, pois os participantes envolvidos parecem já conhecer os principais argumentos uns dos outros e reforçá-los ou questioná-los com a apresentação de outros argumentos e evidências.<h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>No que se refere aos ganhos informacionais proporcionados pelas APs, verifica-se que ao longo dos trabalhos, os participantes contribuíram para a abordagem do tema a partir de diversas perspectivas, ampliando-se o volume, a variedade e a qualidade da informação. As exposições não se restringiram ao tradicional domínio jurídico, estendendo-se a questões técnicas e interdisciplinares, seja porque foi produzido suficiente material para subsidiar a decisão da corte tanto no que diz respeito aos possíveis prognósticos em relação às consequências, implicações e repercussões práticas da legislação discutida, impactos específicos sobre determinados grupos ou acertos em relação a valores fundamentais dos indivíduos e da sociedade brasileira. </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3>Entre 2007 e 2014 o STF fez um uso crescente do mecanismo das audiências públicas para ouvir a opinião de especialistas e representantes de instituições estatais e organizações civis a respeito de temas de grande relevância, complexidade e que envolviam intensa controvérsia pelos potenciais impactos nos campos jurídicos, político, social, econômico e cultural. Genericamente, os ministros do Supremo Tribunal Federal associam às audiências públicas grandes expectativas quanto à ampliação da legitimidade das decisões da Corte, assim como quanto aos ganhos informacionais propiciados pelo mecanismo ao processo decisório, embora nem sempre vinculem uma variável à outra. Contudo, parece haver grande distância entre o discurso e prática quando se considera a forma como as APs vêm sendo empregadas, muito aquém de suas potencialidades, particularmente em face ao grau elevado de discricionariedade do relator, com consequências negativas em termos de garantia quanto à inclusão equânime das partes.Considerando as evidências reunidas sobre o número e o perfil dos participantes das APs no STF destaca-se o potencial desse mecanismo para funcionar como uma importante interface socioestatal, na medida em que conecta atores e instituições e propõem a efetiva conexão de um discurso público mais amplo levado a cabo em uma grande multiplicidade de esferas e arenas. Embora tenha sido possível perceber um processo de institucionalização das APs, expresso pela alteração do Regimento Interno do Supremo Tribunal Federal (RISTF) e pela reiteração de um conjunto de práticas envolvidas na condução das audiências, a análise sugere que várias das diferenças identificadas entre os eventos devem ser explicadas mais pelo grau de adesão, pelas crenças, percepções e escolhas dos ministros do que por outros fatores como tema ou momento de realização da AP, o que expressa a enorme discricionariedade do relator e sua posição privilegiada na rede de atores envolvidos na construção do diálogo interinstitucional e socioestatal. Esta discricionariedade aponta, portanto, para a ausência de garantias institucionais para a inclusividade no processo. O acentuado caráter instrutório de que ainda se revestem as APs, a rigidez na condução dos trabalhos por parte dos relatores, o baixo nível de interação dialógica entre as partes e o caráter sobejamente técnico-científico dos discursos são, sem dúvida, aspectos que contribuem para esse quadro. Vale lembrar, contudo, que houve avanço, quando se considera, comparativamente, as APs. Exemplarmente, as audiências públicas referentes ao debate acerca da constitucionalidade das pesquisas com células-tronco embrionárias e da interrupção da gravidez em casos de anencefalia – cujos debates morais de fundo são similares – apresentaram diferentes padrões de inclusividade, sendo essa última muito mais plural quanto ao tipo de atores, linguagens e formatos discursivos.Por outro lado, as APs realizadas entre 2007 e 2014 variaram tanto em relação ao tipo de controle de constitucionalidade exercido pelo STF, quanto no que diz respeito aos autores/recorrentes envolvidos nos processos que deram origem a elas. No âmbito do controle concentrado, as APs foram realizadas, em sua maioria, em ações de autoria de entidades representativas da sociedade (Partidos Políticos, Sindicatos, entidades de representação de classe e outras associações civis legitimadas para a propositura de ações diretas de constitucionalidade). Inverte-se essa relação quando se observa o universo de recursos extraordinários: nesse caso, que se vincula ao controle difuso de constitucionalidade, as APs realizadas envolviam recursos de autoria de entes estatais (Presidência da República, Governadores de Estados, Mesas do Senado Federal, da Câmara de Deputados e das Assembleias Legislativas, e Ministério Público).Ademais, as APs realizadas pelo STF trataram dos mais diversos assuntos, tais como direito à vida, proteção ao consumidor, princípio da isonomia, liberdade econômica e livre iniciativa, direito à saúde, dignidade da vida e da saúde do trabalhador, defesa do meio ambiente, entre outros. Os eventos foram convocados por diversos ministros. Desde que se realizou a primeira AP, em abril de 2007, o STF já alterou a sua composição sete vezes. Ao todo, atuaram na Corte entre 2007 e 2014, 17 (dezesete) ministros. Destes, 07 (sete) convocaram audiências públicas: Ayres Britto e Ricardo Lewandowski convocaram uma, cada um; Gilmar Medes, Carmen Lúcia e Dias Toffoli convocaram duas, cada um; Marco Aurélio Mello convocou três e Luiz Fux convocou cinco audiências públicas, ainda que tenha tomado posse apenas em 2011. [9]Considerando que os relatores têm discricionariedade para decidir quando convocar ou não uma AP, podemos supor que alguns ministros tenham maior simpatia à novidade institucional do que outros, particularmente quando se observa tamanha variação no tocante ao tipo de controle de constitucionalidade no âmbito do qual as APs foram realizadas, às temáticas envolvidas e aos tipos de autores/recorrentes, como forma de aferir os interesses do estado e da sociedade.As razões expressas nos editais de convocação, por sua vez, remetem ora à qualidade da questão envolvida, destacando sua relevância (jurídica, econômica e social) e natureza controversa, ora ao potencial da própria AP para aplacar os desafios impostos pela construção de uma decisão que é fundamental e envolve um debate que suscita “enfoques diversificados”, numerosos questionamentos, múltiplos entendimentos e várias controvérsias. Associado ao reconhecimento do potencial informacional das APs os editais de convocação são explícitos quanto aos ganhos de legitimidade esperados com a realização do evento, o que também é recorrente nas manifestações dos ministros ao longo das audiências. As falas de abertura e de encerramento das sessões têm funcionado como um momento de reflexão em torno da AP, particularmente em relação aos seus objetivos, às expectativas associadas à sua realização e ao seu significado, seja para o STF, seja para a democracia brasileira.A noção de participação popular, de ouvir “o povo”, “a sociedade” é bastante mobilizada também por representantes do Ministério Público, presentes nas seções, e por muitos daqueles que participavam como expositores. A percepção dos ministros – e expositores – acerca do potencial das audiências públicas no âmbito da jurisdição constitucional parece se fundamentar em um tripé conceitual: legitimidade, participação e informação. A legitimidade democrática do processo decisório se aprofunda pela participação que as audiências públicas promovem, na medida em que se produzem decisões mais bem informadas, considerando não apenas a complexidade técnica das questões envolvidas, mas também o pluralismo moral e as múltiplas perspectivas políticas presentes em sociedade. Evidencia-se, aí, outra característica das audiências públicas: elas possuem um caráter consultivo, pois abrem a possibilidade para que segmentos da sociedade possam se expressar e propor soluções, embora caiba aos ministros acatar ou não as propostas. <p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>AJOUZ, Igor; ALMEIDA, Cecília.

Último acesso em 20/02/2014. [5]Em 2015, foram realizadas 02 (duas) APs não incluídas nesta análise: uma convocada pelo Ministro Luís Roberto Barroso para subsidiar o julgamento da ADI 4.439, que discute os modelos de ensino religioso em escolas públicas e a outra, convocada pelo ministro Gilmar Mendes, para tratar do “uso de depósito judicial”. [6]Em alguns casos, havendo superlotação do local, o Tribunal disponibiliza uma segunda sala para alocar os participantes com transmissão simultânea da AP por meio de telões.[7]O portal do STF disponibiliza, para algumas audiências públicas, textos, documentos e sugestões enviados por instituições e organizações sociais interessadas no tema.[8]Os órgãos e entidades interessadas em indicar especialistas e os amici curiae precisam se inscrever para participar da audiência dentro dos prazos estipulados no edital de convocação. O requerimento de inscrição como expositor deve ser acompanhado do currículo do especialista, bem como do resumo da tese e da posição a ser defendida. [9]Vale a pena destacar que a Audiência Pública realizada em junho de 2015 foi convocada pelo Min. Barroso que, curiosamente, atuou como advogado de entidade civil, interveniente no processo em que se realizou a primeira AP no STF, em 2007.  ","title":"Audiências Públicas no Supremo Tribunal Federal","language":"en","method_id":4395,"authors":[{"user_id":153320,"timestamp":"2016-05-25T11:33:40-07:00","name":"Melodie Jean-baptiste"}]},{"id":4319,"type":"method","original_language":"en","best_for":"Achieving Public Goods","communication_mode":"Dialogue","decision_method":null,"facilitated":true,"governance_contribution":"Preference Articulation","issue_interdependency":null,"issue_polarization":null,"issue_technical_complexity":null,"kind_of_influence":"Collaborative delivery of services with public authorities","method_of_interaction":null,"public_interaction_method":null,"post_date":"2016-02-12T12:42:38.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":"Regional Government (e.g. State, Provincial, Territorial)","typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"National Government","updated_date":"2016-05-25T02:48:02.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<h3>Definition</h3><p> </p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p> </p><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p><strong>(The following description was taken from the case <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/participatory-planning-nepal\">Participatory Planning in Nepal</a>, first posted by <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/people/tsbhusal\">Thanesh Bhusal</a> in October 2015.)</strong></p><p>PP, as a process, offers various opportunities for people to participate, interact, deliberate and thereby influence the overall decision making process. Firstly, the local bodies communicate the policy and budget guidelines to the communities via the Ward Committee (supposed to be elected authority but currently are run by the appointed bureaucrats). The community-based organisations, non-governmental organizations and other sectoral institutions such as the sub-health posts, schools, forest user's committees are invited by TLOs, WCFs, Community Mobilizers and alike to deliberate on the guidelines. The deliberation takes place in public places and any of the community member can participate and join the discussions. A local staff of the municipality is also present in these meetings. Experts, activists including the representatives of local political parties and advocates also take part in the process. </p><p>Then, the decisions of such deliberations are forwarded to the Ward Committee office which organizes a comprehensive workshop (Ward-Bhela) by inviting the selected representatives of community-based organizations where they justify, argue and defend their initial proposals made at the community level. These workshops are also attended by interested ordinary people, local officials, political representatives and media. Such deliberation can happen from few hours to many days. </p><p>Finally, the decisions of Ward-Bhela are then forwarded to the municipal/village secretariat. The municipality then reviews all the proposals. The reviewing process is relatively less open to public however a number of associated institutions such as the Budget Advisory Committee provide extensive feedback onto the proposals. After the revision (mainly from the perspectives of technicality and financial viability), the municipality then organises the meeting of Integrated Planning Formulation Committee (IPFC) which is comprised of all the representatives of communities, NGOs, sectoral organisations and so on. The IPFC deliberates on the refined proposals for many days before recommending the municipal council with the policies to be decided. In absence of elected authorities at the councils, the centrally appointed bureaucrat then endorses the decisions (exactly as is recommended by the IPFC).  </p><h1 class=\"title\"> </h1><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>","title":"Nepalese Participatory Planning ","language":"en","method_id":4319,"authors":[{"user_id":110904,"timestamp":"2016-05-24T19:48:02-07:00","name":"Emma Bélanger"}]},{"id":4381,"type":"method","original_language":"en","best_for":null,"communication_mode":null,"decision_method":null,"facilitated":false,"governance_contribution":null,"issue_interdependency":null,"issue_polarization":null,"issue_technical_complexity":null,"kind_of_influence":null,"method_of_interaction":null,"public_interaction_method":null,"post_date":"2016-05-16T22:16:07.000Z","published":true,"typical_funding_source":null,"typical_implementing_entity":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":null,"updated_date":"2016-05-16T23:24:29.000Z","lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["EBM","ecosystem-based management"],"body":"<p>(Note: This article is a stub and requires further elaboration and editing)</p>\n<p>Definition:</p>\n<p>Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a concept that links human and ecological systems through adaptive management approaches. Generally, EBM promotes human well-being by managing for the coexistence of &quot;healthy, fully functioning ecosystems and human communities&quot; (CIT, 2004, pg. 9). EBM is also theorized to be collaborative insofar as it fosters participation and encourages respect for the diverse values and aspirations of communities. Moreover, Parsons (2015) suggests this management paradigm exhibits various &quot;ecological&#039;, &#039;managing uncertainty&#039;, and &#039;social&#039; principles.</p>\n<p>Principles of EBM (Adapted from Parsons, 2015, pg. 23)</p>\n<p>1. Ecological</p>\n<p>Maintain Ecological Integrity: Ecological Integrity is the abundance and diversity of organisms at all levels, and the ecological patterns, processes, and structural attributes responsible for that biological diversity and for ecosystem resilience (CIT, 2004, pg.13).</p>\n<p>Ecological Boundaries: Management that recognizes and follows ecological boundaries such as watershed boundaries is more effective at maintaining ecological integrity of an ecosystem than management that follows political (jurisdictional boundaries)</p>\n<p>Hierarchical Context: It is essential that managers make connections between patterns and processes at all scales within an ecosystem, including site, neighbourhood, ecosystem, and regional scales and species, population, ecosystem, and watershed levels of analysis.</p>\n<p>2. Managing Uncertainty</p>\n<p>Data Collection: Data collection involves collection of both social and ecological data to establish the condition of an ecosystem and to implement monitoring (Slocombe, 1998a).</p>\n<p>Monitoring: Monitoring involves identifying and using data and indicators of change to characterize ecosystem status and maintenance/improvement of health.</p>\n<p>Adaptive Management: Adaptive Management is a systematic and iterative approach for improving resource management by emphasizing learning from management outcomes (Bormann, Haynes, &amp; Martin, 2007). Adaptive management involves testing assumptions and exploring alternatives. Data collection and monitoring can be seen as components of the adaptive management cycle</p>\n<p>3.

The association self-identifies as a nationally-organized resistance to the arbitrary eviction and force homelessness of the urban poor, displaced persons and ethnic/religious minorities. It also advocates for affordable housing for low-income families. Its workers do consciousness-raising and provide social, political and legal education and facilitate peaceful mobilization for housing and land reform</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Due to the rise in post-conflict migration, unprecedented degree of economic growth and increase in poverty, informal living arrangments of more than 40 homes named katchi abadis are expanding in Pakistan's major cities.  The settlements are homes to the most marginalized, economically and socially, members of Pakistani society from ethnic minorities to low-income families. The communities house mostly workers who provide critical labour to local economies but are undervalued, underpaid and denied basic rights to shelter, fair wages, water and education. The livelihoods of the residents is under constant arbitrary threat by state violence and evictions. </p><p>The National Housing Policy 2001 demands that existing katchi abadis be regularized and upgraded, the dwellers be granted ownership rights of the land they occupy and the Capital Development Authority provide basic services of water, electricity and gas. However, the CDA only recognizes 10 settlements as of yet and continues to ignore the no-eviction clause of the 2001 Housing Policy</p><p><strong>Specializations and activities</strong></p><p>The association works with over 14 katchi abadis, with a population of over 150,000 in the nation's capital, Islamabad, in coalition with the Awami Workers' Party.

Disseminating information about past and present government policies, actions and initiatives.<br />b. Dialogue about the economic, social and political power structures that exist in the country and beyond. <br />c. Raising awareness about the political and legal rights of the abadi residents, as slum-dwellers and citizens of Pakistan.<br />d. Outlining the need for peaceful social, political and community organization beyond religious, sectarian, ethnic and gender differences.\"</p><p>2) The organization also helps residents strenghten existing forms of community organization to contest illegal attempts of eviction by building a \"sustainable organizational structure for the future defense of their rights and positioning of their lawful demands\". APKAA works to create dialogue between abadi residents, civil society, students, academics and other social movements by creating spaces for discussion, joint-lobbying strategies and mobilization.</p><p>3)APKAA has a special commitment to strenghtening the abilities of youth and women's groups to use means of communication to express themselves and disseminate information such as wall painting, informative pamphlets and social media technologies. </p><p> </p><p>4)The association seeks to influence government decision-making through protests, organized demonstrations and legal claims. Its current agenda involves organizing a rally on land rights in conversation with the Supreme Court's hearing on the Awami Workers' Party's petition' for a judicial review on previous rulings of land reform.  This is a coalitional effort between katchi abadi residents of Islamabad and the landless farmers of Punjab.</p><p> </p><p>The next few years for the organization will consist of entering local and provincial politics through the electoral system in hopes of amplifying voices that represent the needs of the Pakistan's poorest.</p><p><strong>Funding</strong></p><p>Its activities are funded by donors and local supporters of the Awami Workers' Party.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AllianceforKachiAbadis/info?tab=page_info\">https://www.facebook.com/AllianceforKachiAbadis/info?tab=page_info</a></p><h3><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1275518\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1275518</a></h3><p><a href=\"http://awamiworkersparty.org/campaigns/katchi-abadi-timeline/\">http://awamiworkersparty.org/campaigns/katchi-abadi-timeline/</a></p>","title":"All-Pakistani Alliance for Katchi Abadis","language":"en","organization_id":4540,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-08-12T23:17:01-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4536,"type":"organization","original_language":"en","executive_director":"Emma Lawson and Emily Jenke","issue":null,"post_date":"2016-08-10T10:40:13.000Z","published":true,"sector":"For Profit","updated_date":"2016-08-10T11:44:38.000Z","location":{"name":null,"address1":"Halifax Street","address2":null,"city":"Adelaide","province":"South Australia","country":"Australia","postal_code":"SA 5000","latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E"},"lead_image":{"url":"main-logo.png","title":"Democracy Co","size":null},"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":["citizens jury","co-design"],"body":"<p>The following entry has been summarised from <a href=\"http://www.democracyco.com.au/\">Democracy Co's website</a>.

Individuals, groups and members of civil society are often faced with material, epistemic and social threats to expressing, developing and publishing voices on social justice issues such as violence against religious minorities, missing and murdered Balochistani activists and academics and gendered violence.</p><p><strong>History/Overview</strong></p><p>Inspired by the revolutionary roots of the Pak Tea House in Lahore, The Second Floor Café (T2F), founded in 2007, is a coffeeshop, bookstore, politico-cultural community space and alternative learning centre in Karachi, Pakistan dedicated to promoting democratic discourse and conflict resolution through intellectual and cultural engagement. PeaceNiche and T2F are founded by Sabeen Mahmud, a local and global activist, graphic designer/tech consultant, human rights advocate from Karachi who was murdered by an armed gunman on April 24 2015 after hosting the seminar “Unsilencing Balochistan”. It is the first of its kind in the nation, and has inspired many other café/community spaces to open up from Lahore to Lyari. Self-defined as a social entrepreneurship project, T2F relies on participation from local artists, activists, thought leaders and engaged audiences to revitalize Karachi’s cultural and political landscapes by offering an alternative and space for discourse. It has and continues to provide space for local social movements and activists targeted by land mafias, the military and government such as Citizens Campaign to Reclaim Karachi and Balochi activist Mama Qadeer.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mission:</strong></p><p>Its primary focus is 1) strengthening the voice of Pakistan’s developing civil society through: 1) alleviation of intellectual poverty, 2) providing a platform for dialogue and creative expression, 3) social change through the arts, 4)development of a vibrant community of civic-minded citizens,5) supporting local entrepreneurship, 6)accessible early childhood education programming and 7)youth engagement. Towards this goal, some on-going projects at the T2F include Faraar, a visual arts gallery to promote local talent and social change through art, Science ka Adda, a platform for debate on the role and influence of science on our lives, Urdu Preservation Project, an archival project for urdu poetry and prose, and Raahnuma, an online resource for victims of violence and abuse. </p><p><strong>Funding:</strong></p><p>It is funded as a branch of the PeaceNiche project, a not-for-profit organization in Karachi, Pakistan founded in hopes of creating a space for rational, creative and critical dialogue to counter growing religion-based violence, corruption, mafia-presence and extremism in Karachi. Though initially ran out of Mahmud’s own pockets, after relocating to a donated rent-free space, maintenance and salaries are covered through different grants. The café now operates on an honour code, where some individuals pay nothing and others donate generously.</p><p><strong>Membership:</strong></p><p>The café has an open door, open mind policy and has hosted people from all walks of life willing to participate in democratic dialogue from students, elders, exiled leaders from skype, interfaith representatives, security and military professionals.</p><p><strong>Major Projects and Events</strong></p><p>The multi-purpose café functions as a medium for mobilizing political resources, a community space for dialogue and deliberation and finally, as a site for preserving the intellectual and critical strain of Islamic and Pakistani traditions. The events hosted include everything from workshops/seminars on sectarian violence, state violence against and upon Balochistan, critiquing the blasphemy laws, critical and interfaith religious studies to stand up comedy and open mic shows. One event which illustrates how the café mobilizes community members to solve civic problems is the Civic Hackathon in which developers, urban cartographers, data analysts, and designers/developers gathered to create web and mobile solutions to Pakistan’s civic issues such as crime mapping to emergency services, disaster relief, and improving quality of education. Other programs include Philosophy 101, Traditional Music Preservation series  and Zambeel Dramatic Reading group.</p><p><strong>Notes and Analysis:</strong></p><p>What separates T2F from other not-for-profits is its specific focus on developing civil society for the sake of building capacities for democracy through the relationships between citizens, especially relationships with marginalized members and voices in Pakistani society. This has democratic value in and of itself, building trust and solidarity between and across sectarian, ethnic and regional differences for more effective coalitional critiques against the state violence and corruption. Unlike in other countries, because of Pakistan’s, and especially Karachi’s, security situation, the cultural, artsy and critical nature of T2Fs activities and mission have not only a democratic function but also, a revolutionary aim to reclaim the city from the hands of the land mafia, the corrupt political parties and feudalist strife. One issue with the project is that because of the security situation, the activities and events are not broadcasted, publicized on a large national or even media scale. With the murder of the founder Sabeen Mahmud, the organization has a lot of political enemies/critics whose gaze must be avoided by the project. And so, most of its activities and their influence stays within a very local, off-the-radar, and directly in response to local communities of Karachi. Though its influence and capacity for social change may not directly bring about democratic social change at the level of the state,  the café is  a space for cultural preservation and building agentic capacities through awareness/education, a place to retreat to from the violence, to become stronger for the tougher political landscapes and climates outside, and to-come.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Secondary sources/External Links</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://codeforpakistan.org/programs/civic-hackathons/karachi-civic-hackathon/\">http://codeforpakistan.org/programs/civic-hackathons/karachi-civic-hackathon/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://universalistmuslims.tumblr.com/post/117430599022/sabeen-mahmud-founder-of-the-ngo-peace-niche-and\">http://universalistmuslims.tumblr.com/post/117430599022/sabeen-mahmud-founder-of-the-ngo-peace-niche-and</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/karima-bennoune/in-memory-of-sabeen-mahmud-\">https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/karima-bennoune/in-memory-of-sabeen-mahmud-“i-stand-up-for-what-i-believe-in-but-i-can’t-fight-</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/INOV_a_00185\">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/INOV_a_00185</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.t2f.biz\">http://www.t2f.biz</a></p><p> </p>","title":"The Second Floor Cafe","language":"en","organization_id":4480,"authors":[{"user_id":169032,"timestamp":"2016-07-31T22:36:54-07:00","name":"Jack Knight"}]},{"id":4523,"type":"organization","original_language":"en","executive_director":null,"issue":"Environment","post_date":"2016-07-31T04:31:05.000Z","published":true,"sector":"For Profit","updated_date":"2016-07-31T04:31:05.000Z","location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":null,"province":null,"country":"Australia","postal_code":null,"latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E"},"lead_image":null,"other_images":[{"url":"b40b53_2e83c516a990432a9e7b975eaa6cf802.gif","title":null,"size":null}],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<p><em>Note: the following article is a stub.

What inspired this group into creation was the Zina Ordinance’s application to the case of Fehmida and Allah Bux which conflated adultery with rape. Within months of its founding, chapters of WAF opened up in Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar. WAF was the face of feminism in Pakistan in the 80s, with picketing, demonstrations, processions, rallies, signature campaigns, consciousness-raising, telegrams, and writing memorandums and letters as their forms of protest and contestation. The organizations current goals include women’s representation in parliament, consciousness-raising in regards to family planning, and making public statements on women’s issues. Though Membership was once mostly women from elite, upper class families, it now includes women from different backgrounds, in different regions.</p><p><strong>Analysis and criticism:</strong></p><p>As one of the first organizations to apologize to Bangladeshi women for the crimes against humanity from the 1971 war, to deliberatively deciding to advocate for a secular, democratic nation state, WAF is an intersectional, inclusive and feminist organization. WAF is known as one of the last remaining autonomous, political and women’s rights organizations in Pakistan that has not been hijacked by the neoliberal development agenda.

SPO has 9 permanent offices in major Pakistani cities and two project offices, with its National Centre in Islamabad. According to CIDA, the organization has officially helped train and offer technical assistance to 105 community-based organizations, and 78 women’s organizations on rights-based approaches, democratic behavior, and gender and environment issues. The organization has also helped 305 projects create successful grants for funding from different donors as well as many other improvements and contributions to community development in Pakistan.</p><p><strong>Funding</strong>:</p><p>The project began with funding from Canadian International Development Agency.

It monitors government progress in this regard, particularly to ensure access for the poor and vulnerable populations. Their mission is to work towards a South Africa where the constitution is upheld and human rights are recognized in law and respected in practice and the government is accountable and responsive to the people. </p><h3>History</h3><p>The organisation has a long history of working against injustice in the country. The Black Sash was established in 1955 by a small group of white middle-class women (who were predominantly English-speaking) when they formed an organization called The Women's Defence of the Constitution League. Founder members were Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton-Thompson (among others). The organisation was formed as a protest to oppose the Senate Bill that aimed to remove coloureds from the common voter’s role as the women of Black Sash believed this action was against the ‘spirit of the constitution. Though the organisation was established as means to highlight the unconstitutional actions taken by the apartheid government, it became a platform for liberal women to oppose the apartheid policies through protests, marches and vigils. The name Black Sash originated from the women’s use of black sashes as a symbol to mourn the death of the constitution. </p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>The organisation currently works in three main areas, rights-based information, education and training, community monitoring, and advocacy in partnership. The Black Sash publishes historical archives and activities from their advice offices and fieldwork activities as part of their educational campaigns. Black Sash has advice offices across the country, including a helpline where the public can ask questions on any matter regarding human rights. Their activities include advocacy work, where they engage government on behalf of communities, as well as monitoring government action in terms of ensuring access to rights. Their first advice office was opened in Cape Town during apartheid in an effort to assist victims of apartheid legislation within lawful means. The organisation’s activities continue to help communities across South Africa.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>The Black Sash has been involved in a variety of projects, including: Community Monitoring and Advocacy, Reproductive Maternal and Child Health projects, and the Making All Voices Count pilot project to mention a few. The Community Monitoring and Advocacy project was implemented by driven communities through civil society organisations, who supported and trained volunteers as monitors in the project. The project identified the South African Social Security Agency, Department of Health, Department of Home Affairs and municipalities for monitoring.</p><p>The purpose of the Reproductive Maternal and Child Health project is to assist government in ensuring access to reproductive healthcare services and improve the quality of service particularly for the poor. The project aims to:</p><p>·         Support districts to oversee improvement of MNCH services.</p><p>·         Strengthen delivery of school health, ward-based primary health care, and obstetric and neonatal emergency services.</p><p>·          Improve demand and accountability for MNCH services.</p><p>·         Document and disseminate new knowledge to remove barriers to the   uptake and access to MNCH services.</p><p>The Making All Voices Count project is part of a global initiative which aims to empower Community Based Organisations to take ownership of and participate actively in citizen-based monitoring of three government services in 20 service sites across South Africa. The aim of the project is to monitor the rendering of government services from the perspective of ordinary people in an effort to promote better service standards.  </p><h3>Funding</h3><p> </p><h3>Publications</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/black-sash\">http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/black-sash</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/community-monitoring-and-advocacy-programme\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/community-monitoring-and-advocacy-programme</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/reproductive-mother-and-child-health\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/reproductive-mother-and-child-health</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/making-all-voices-count\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/making-all-voices-count</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>","title":"Black Sash","language":"en","organization_id":4356,"authors":[{"user_id":147792,"timestamp":"2016-07-25T23:15:56-07:00","name":"Beatrice Jones"}]},{"id":216,"type":"organization","original_language":"en","executive_director":"Iain Walker","issue":"Other","post_date":"2016-05-13T19:12:27.000Z","published":true,"sector":"Non-Profit or Non Governmental","updated_date":"2016-07-26T06:12:03.000Z","location":{"name":null,"address1":"P.O.

This is underpinned by the conviction that a random selection of everyday citizens are more than capable of navigating and making decisions about complex political issues. As founder Luca Belgiorno-Nettis (2013) <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/founder-s-messages/202-founder-s-message\">puts it</a>:</p><p><em>Our focus is on everyday people being randomly selected to deliberate and see if a consensus view can be reached. I am willing to trust these people because of the diversity of skills in the community, and the fact they are beyond the reach of so many impairments we place on the judgment of the representatives we elect today. They have no political donations, no factions, no pre-selections to worry about, no special interest groups to campaign against them, no lobbyists with connections to them, no faceless men looming in the background! </em></p><p>nDF’s approach is firmly underpinned by deliberative democratic theory. In creating deliberative spaces – such as the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/australias-first-citizens-parliament-canberra-australia\">Australian Citizens’ Parliament</a> – the foundation aims to contribute to a future deliberative community as envisaged by prominent scholars (see for example Gastil 2007; Parkinson 2015). Indeed, since newDemocracy’s inception in 2004, deliberative democracy scholars have begun to look to the idea of ‘deliberative systems’ as a way of conceptualising deliberative democracy writ large (eg. Dryzek 2009) . In many ways nDF was ahead of the game when they launched; their original objectives were, through the creation of deliberative spaces, to promote a broader shift towards a more participatory, consensus-based political system. This is in sharp contrast to the adversarial, polarising rhetoric of Australian party politics.</p><p>newDemocracy is now well established in Australia as one of the foremost practitioners of deliberative democracy. They are particularly well-known for expertise in the recruitment process and facilitation of citizens’ juries, as their body of work attests. nDF also retains its original commitment to changing Australia’s political system for the better, through establishing effective mechanisms for everyday people to deliberate and make public decisions. This is reflected in their advocacy for a <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/alternatives/structural/99-a-citizens-senate\">Citizens’ Senate</a> – with a House of randomly selected citizens performing the review function of the Upper House. This is ‘the pragmatic option for a step toward a non-partisan and deliberative parliament.’</p><p>The Citizens’ Senate is one of several <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/alternatives/structural/99-a-citizens-senate\">structural alternatives</a> advocated by nDF for improving how politics is done in Australia. These include Demarchy, and Electronic Townhall and a Citizens’ Legislature. The structural alternatives suggested are grounded in academic research and offer a vision for a different type of politics. Alongside this they also argue in favour of a raft of<a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/alternatives/incremental\"> incremental alternatives</a> – improvements that could be made to the current political system as it stands. </p><h2>History</h2><p>nDF was founded in 2004 by Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, who <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/founder-s-messages/202-founder-s-message\">‘wanted to find out if innovation in democracy was possible. It is.’</a> newDemocracy’s inception was a considered response against the often toxic, tit-for-tat character of partisan politics in Australia. nDF advocated a real alternative to this in their support for deliberative democratic processes that gave ordinary people the time, space and relevant information to deliberate on the current political system and how it could be improved.</p><p>This alternative approach became tangible reality with the first Australian Citizens’ Parliament in 2009, funded by nDF and the Australian Research Council. The focus of the process – involving 150 randomly selected Australians – was to deliberate on how Australian’s political system could be strengthened to better serve its citizens.</p><p>Since the Citizens’ Parliament, nDF have become perhaps best known for their expertise in random selection and the organisation and facilitation of mini-publics. They have been commissioned by local councils and state governments across four states to run deliberative processes on diverse topics – from electoral reform to local infrastructure. In addition to running deliberative forums, nDF advocates deliberative democratic approaches – in particular the citizens’ jury model – directly to state and federal government through its submissions to various committees.</p><h2><strong>Specializations and Activities</strong></h2><p>A random selection of citizens in a jury format – a citizens’ jury – is central to newDemocracy’s approach to improving the democratic process. The following information is summarised from the <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury\">nDF website</a> and describes their overall approach:</p><p><em>Random Selection:</em></p><p>Governments inevitably hear from the noisiest voices who insist on being heard. In contrast, society trusts 12 randomly-selected people on a criminal jury to assess evidence, discuss their views and reach a consensus recommendation because random selection generates “people like us”. Our process gets beyond the enraged and the articulate because the public would perceive them as having a bias.</p><p><em>Time:</em></p><p>Most policy problems which warrant the investment in a jury will be complex topics, so we need to allow people the time to educate and immerse themselves in the topic. Faced with a clear remit and a worthwhile level of authority citizens will invest the time.</p><p><em>Information:</em></p><p>Neutrality of information is a core principle, and we are careful to alert all juries that all writers have their own bias and perspective and they need to critically analyse this. To counter the view that “you can find an expert to say anything” we focus the start of a process on asking “what do you need to know… and who would you trust to inform you” – and use this as a way of selecting the speakers and input for subsequent jury meetings.</p><p><em>Clear remit:</em></p><p>A plain English question, phrased neutrally is essential.</p><p><em>Upfront authority:</em></p><p>To get everyday people in the room making a considerable time commitment, they need to know that the recommendations they reach mean something and won’t be consumed within the bureaucracy.</p><p><em>Operation:</em></p><p>For the purposes of shifting the mindset from adversarial, two-party, either/or contests, nDF recommends an 80% supermajority be required for a final decision from the jury. In practice, they rarely need to go to a vote and decisions are frequently unanimous, however minority views can be recorded and noted in reports as the objective is to most accurately reflect the view of the room.</p><p><em>How do we randomly select participants?</em></p><p>nDF directly undertakes the jury selection process to ensure there is the highest public confidence in the rigour and independence of the randomisation of invitations. Random selection is the key tool used to identify a range of participants who meet a descriptively representative sample of the community. We match participants to Census data by the key variables of age and gender, and others as each project requires. This is not claimed as a perfect method, but it delivers a more representative sample than any other process.</p><p>We post invitations to a random sample of physical addresses (not billing addresses) drawn from land titles information or Australia Post databases. This ensures that tenants and those not on electoral rolls are reached – in short, the widest possible catchment. Recipients of the invitation are asked to register online to indicate that they are available for the final selection. Based on those available, a second random draw is done which seeks to randomly match to the age and gender numbers required. This draw generates the final membership of the jury.</p><p>nDF does not provide any juror information to the governments or agencies with which we work. </p><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p><p>Since its inception in 2004, nDF has sought to improve and innovate with its work. nDF-commissed <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/docs/activeprojects/safesydney2014/nDF%20final%20report_May2015.pdf\">research conducted by the Institute for Sustainable Futures</a> in 2015 found that stakeholders did not always feel they understood the deliberative process and for some, this led to disengagement. In response to this, nDF now includes stakeholder engagement as a key component in all of its research designs. This includes stakeholder briefings prior to the process beginning, identifying key stakeholders to present to a jury or panel, as well as offering jurors the opportunity to select stakeholders of their own choosing to present information. This is alongside witnesses chosen by the commissioning body (eg. council) and submissions from the wider community.</p><p><strong>Major projects and events</strong></p><p>nDF has been responsible for over 20 deliberative processes, consultations and policy submissions. Their first major project was the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/australias-first-citizens-parliament-canberra-australia\">Australian Citizens’ Parliament</a> in 2009 which brought together 150 citizens from around the country.</p><p>Other major projects include the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/city-melbourne-peoples-panel\">City of Melbourne People’s Panel</a> in 2014, which involved a broad community engagement process alongside a citizens’ jury to contribute to Melbourne’s 10-year financial plan. nDF also led on two juries in <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/city-sydney-safe-and-vibrant-nightlife\">Sydney</a> and <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/creating-safe-and-vibrant-adelaide-nightlife\">Adelaide</a> on creating a safe and vibrant nightlife.</p><p>nDF’s full body of work – along with reports, project designs and government responses can be found <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/our-work\">here</a>.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>nDF is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation and relies primarily on <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/get-involved/funding\">donors</a> for its income and has received major donations from the Anita and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis Foundation and Google Australia. In addition, the foundation is commissioned by government and others to run various projects, which are budgeted on a cost recovery basis and vary project to project.</p><p>nDF also funds research into deliberative democracy more broadly. Details of its 2015 funded projects is available <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/research-funding-2015\">here</a>.</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>nDF posts research papers relevant to deliberative democracy and community engagement in full on their website and can be viewed <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/research-papers\">here</a>.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Carson, L. & Gastil, J.

Aicher sold his business and used the proceeds to establish the Topsfield Foundation, Inc. Based in Pomfret, Conn., The Topsfield Foundation dedicated itself to enhancing civic engagement through public dialogue. Later, in 1989, the foundation established the Study Circles Resource Center as its primary project.</p><p>In the early 1990s, the Study Circles Resource Center created and distributed tools such as discussion guides to help individuals in local communities engage in inclusive talk about public issues and controversies. Throughout the 1990s, the organization fostered a national network of discursive coalitions that addressed issues such as racism, inter-ethnic relations, and diversity. Since the 2000, the organization expanded its activities to include community organizing in order to diversify participation in dialogue and focus attention on action as well as deliberation. In 2008, the organization changed its name from the Study Circles Resource Center to Everyday Democracy to reflect its increased attention to collective action and public problem solving. The organization provides this <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.everyday-democracy.org//en/Page.HistoryTimeline.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.everyday-democracy.org//en/Page.HistoryTimeline.aspx\">timeline of its history</a>.</p><p><a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>Everyday Democracy provides various kinds of assistance to help individuals in local communities engage in problem-solving deliberation and social action. The organization provides how-to guides on organizing dialogues and facilitation as well as a large number of “discussion guides,” videos, and books on issues such as racism and racial equity, urban sprawl, education, poverty, and immigration. In the communities where Everyday Democracy provides customized technical assistance, program staff coach local people, serving as resources and trainers to help communities build their own abilities to create change.

Its founders Eyal Halamish and Matthew Gordon, together with friends, designed an online community engagement platform to do just this. Perhaps most importantly, OurSay envisage community engagement as a reciprocal process and the platform facilitates two way communication between communities and decision makers.</p><p><em>We want to ensure that in today's digital and social world, both decision makers and their communitiesare able to proactively engage with each other to make the relevant decisions </em>(OurSay 2016)</p><h3>History</h3><p>OurSay is based in Melbourne, Australia. Its two key founders were motivated 'to do something about the lack of trust and authenticity in government decision making' (OurSay 2016). In an effort to address this huge challenge, a founding group designed an online platform through which communities and decision-makers can engage in a meaningful way.</p><p>The platform's debut was during the 2010 federal elections in Australia. Members of the public were able to pose questions to candidates, and other users then voted for their top questions. OurSay aims to provide prior commitments from politicians to provide responses to the top questions.  </p><p>Since its inception the organisation has attracted a large membership and involvement from some senior Australian politicians including Premier Julia Gillard in 2012.  </p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>OurSay's main speciality is its online forum platform, which encompasses the following elements:</p><ul><li>the forum: the online space dedicated to discussing a particular topic or project that has been set up. OurSay work with governments and local councils to set up forums on various issues, such as <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/whats-big-idea-hepburn-shire-councils-plan\">Hepburn Shire's Council Plan</a>. Each forum usually lasts for around 3-4 weeks and has a 'forum leader' (the decision maker or organisation) who commits to answering the most popular questions.</li><li>questions: participants in a forum can post a question, as many as they like. They are encouraged to 'campaign' for their question through posting on social media and engaging with networks of friends, colleagues and so on.</li><li>voting: each forum participant is allocated 7 votes. They can use these votes as they like to vote for the questions they most want answers to.</li><li>responses: once the forum has closed, the forum leader will provide a response. This is not just posting a written response; they could respond through a media interview or webcast, or through a live 'response event' at a meeting or public event. All responses are recorded by OurSay and posted on the forum. </li></ul><p>OurSay also provide a variety of other <a href=\"https://oursay.org/gov/product-and-services.html\">online engagement products and services</a>.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>In 2012 the then Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard agreed to answer three questions chosen by Australian citizens through OurSay. She responded to the winning questions through a <a href=\"https://oursay.org/hangout-with-the-prime-minister\">Google Hangout</a> which was broadcast by OurSay. 2,057 questions received over a hundred thousand votes with the winning questions covering same-sex marriage, military pensions and the government-funded school chaplaincy program. </p><p>In 2013 <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/node/add/case\">OurSay partnered with Hepburn Shire Council</a> in Victoria to create a four year plan for the area with extensive community engagement. In this case, community members were able to pitch an idea for the Shire and the top ten voted ideas were discussed in person at a meeting with councillors, staff and the community.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>OurSay is a social enterprise organisation. It is indepedent and non-partisan. At the time of writing it could not be determined whether OurSay is a for-profit or non-profit business. </p><p>The enterprise was started up with a $10,000 gift in 2009 (OurSay 2016).</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>OurSay (2016) About Us [online], available at: <a href=\"http://oursay.org/gov/about.html\">http://oursay.org/gov/about.html</a></p><p>OurSay (2016) How it works [online], available at: <a href=\"https://oursay.org/how-it-works \">https://oursay.org/how-it-works </a></p><h3>External Links</h3><p>Short, M (2012) Power to the People, <em>The Age</em> [online], 3 December, available at:<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/power-to-the-people-20121202-2ap4h.html\">http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/power-to-the-people-20121202-2...</a></p><p>Wikipedia (2014) <em>OurSay</em> [online], available at: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OurSay \">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OurSay </a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>","title":"OurSay","language":"en","organization_id":4497,"authors":[{"user_id":134860,"timestamp":"2016-07-20T21:35:58-07:00","name":"Ryan Côté"}]},{"id":4468,"type":"organization","original_language":"en","executive_director":"Arun Maira","issue":"Economic Development","post_date":"2016-07-06T03:43:24.000Z","published":true,"sector":"Non-Profit or Non Governmental","updated_date":"2016-07-06T03:43:24.000Z","location":{"name":null,"address1":null,"address2":null,"city":"Jaipur ","province":"Rajasthan","country":"India","postal_code":null,"latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E"},"lead_image":null,"other_images":[],"files":[],"videos":[],"tags":[],"body":"<p><em>Note: the following article is a stub.

It draws on a number of methods to develop its own <a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=AboutUs&action=Index&static=1\">methodology</a>.</p><p>21st Century Dialogue aims to create processes that are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=AboutUs&action=Index&static=1\">inclusive (representative of the population and inclusive of groups who are often not heard);</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=AboutUs&action=Index&static=1\">deliberative (opportunities for informed discussion, small group dialogue - speaking and listening to all views -, to find alternatives and seek common ground); and</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=AboutUs&action=Index&static=1\">influential (has the capacity to influence policy development or decision making)</a></li></ul><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>The following is taken from 21st Century Dialogue's website and outlines the development of their approach:</p><p><em>The 21st Century Dialogue methodology has been adapted from 21st Century Town Meetings -large-scale public participation processes, originally developed in the USA by AmericaSpeaks and applied across the USA, including with nearly 5,000 residents after September 11 to plan for the future of the Ground Zero site in New York; and more recently at the World Economic Forum Meeting at Davos in Switzerland with 700 of the world’s political, economic and social leaders. <br /><br />This engagement process uses small group, facilitated deliberation together with networked computer technology, to enable the room’s key themes to be broadcast to the entire room virtually in ‘real time’. At each table, ideas are submitted to the computer including individual, team and strongly held minority views. Table inputs are relayed to a theme team who synthesise the results and display them to the room on large screens. Key issues are prioritised, with each participant nominating their individual preferences. Preferential rakings in the form of a histogram are projected back into the room in ‘real time’. At the conclusion of the forum, each participant is given a Preliminary Report of the outcomes of the forum. <br /><br />The consultants from 21st Century Dialogue have developed their own technology – software and networked computers – as well as the interactive group dynamics system to suit Australian requirements. They have carried out this format for Dialogue with the City (1,100 participants), Dialogue with the Pilbara: Newman 2020 (120 participants); Port Hedland Enquiry by Design (140 participants), Dialogue with Bunbury (300 participants) and Cockburn Vision Dialogue (200 participants). Dr Janette Hartz-Karp will continue with the role of designing, coordinating and lead facilitating. Les Buchanan, will continue in the role of controlling the event management. David Bruce, will continue with the design and analysis of the survey methodologies. The 21st Century Dialogue computer technology has been tried and tested on many occasions, and the computing consultant, Leor Karp will continue to provide the computing support.</em></p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=AboutUs&action=Index&static=1\">21st Century Dialogue's methodology </a>combines a range of established methods including: </p><ul><li>\"<a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/consensus-conference\">Consensus Forums</a> – which ensure that participation is representative of the population, there is informed deliberation and in-depth dialogue, and the initiative has the capacity to influence policy development and decision-making.</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/21st-century-town-meeting\">21st Century Town Meetings</a> – with custom developed computer software that is unique, reliable and flexible, training of support personnel that is targeted and effective, and agendas that deliver the outcomes set at the commencement of the engagement.</li><li>Community Surveys - that are statistically rigorous, creatively discern people’s attitudes and values, and reported in a user-friendly style.</li><li>Event management - that is customer focussed, efficient and flexible.\" </li></ul><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>21st Century Dialogue has been involved with a wide range of engagement activities and deliberative processes in Western Australia in the past 15 years.</p><p>Their website includes an <a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&action=Index&static=\">index of previous initiatives</a> which each have a detailed outline available.
