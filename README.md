## Participedia Front-end code

This is a static content front-end site which powers the upcoming version 3
of Participedia.net.

It uses `hjs-webpack` for the basic build/update configuration.

## Development Approach

React, redux where appropriate; react-router for all routes; `react-intl` localization (all copy should be localized).
`Auth0` for authentication.
